## Assignment 4 {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" }

**Getting Involved in our Community**

<br>

**Find or create** an opportunity to get **actively involved in your issue locally** (e.g. litter pickup, river cleanup, working with a local NGO or city agency on your issue, etc.)

**Write a report** describing what you did, who you worked with and what you learned that will help you with solving your chosen policy problem.

::: notes

Reminder, you have until April 26th to complete your community involvement piece of the project.

- Don't let this fall off your radar

- don't forget you must get my sign-off on the proposal as a Canvas assignment!

- Spring Break is coming up and that's often a great time to get involved outside!

<br>

### Questions on this assignment?

## Section 2 {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png"  .center}

**Evaluating Policy Design Options**

<br>

1.  **Command & Control Regulations**

2.  "Green" Taxes

3.  "Green" Subsidies

4.  Adaptive Governance

::: notes

Last week we explored command and control regulations.

<br>

### In broad strokes, what does it mean to use C&C regulations to address an environmental problem?

- (Create rules that alter the behavior of specific actors)

- Examples:
    - Firms/Consumers must use technology X, OR
    
    - Firms/Consumers cannot emit more than a set limit of pollution Y

<br>

In Econ 101 speak, per the textbook: C&C means using rules to force polluters to adapt their production functions to the social costs of pollution

- **SLIDE**: What does that mean? Back to the picture!

**What does the supply line represent and why is it increasing?**

- (Marginal costs e.g. amount it costs to produce one more widget)

- (Assumes marginal costs increase with quantity of product produced, e.g. sourcing more materials for your factory or building new equipment to extract oil from harder to work places, etc.)

<br>

### What does the demand line represent and why is it decreasing?
- (Amount of widgets you can sell at a given price point)

- (Only so many people want the product at all and (almost) everyone's desire for it will be sensitive to the price you charge for it.)

<br>

### As the owner of the factory how many widgets should I make?

The equilibrium point, where the lines cross, maximizes your profit!

- The point where you balance the marginal costs of production against the demand of your customers at a given price point

::: notes

Marginal cost per widget goes up SO you have to charge more for each of them, BUT consumers don't want your widgets at those prices

- You are now losing money (in ever growing amounts) for every extra widget you produce

- So, push up the line and go bankrupt!

<br>

### And why shouldn't I, the factory owner, reduce the number of widgets I make in order to take advantage of the very high demand for a small number of widgets?

::: notes

1. (You're leaving profit on the table, and)

2. (You're daring other companies to come into your market in order to meet the consumer demand!)

<br>

The key for us here is to acknowledge how powerful the equilibrium point is for determining the behavior of the factory!

- The equilibrium point will be somewhat self-enforcing!

<br>

### Now then, what happens if we add a C&C regulation requiring new, cleaner technology be added to the factory?

  annotate("segment", x = 0, xend = 100, y = 15, yend = 65, color = "grey", size = 1.3)
```

::: notes

Rules that mandate emissions limits or the specific technology a factory has to use increases the marginal costs of production.

- This shifts the equilibrium point to the left

- The results: The factory will produce fewer widgets, the price for widgets goes up and the amount of pollution created goes down

<br>

And remember, this is not always a net negative for the economy!

- Regulation design matters!

- Higher costs can inspire innovation and efficiency
    - New products can come online to replace the older, dirtier widgets

- Higher costs and unmet demand can inspire competition

<br>

### Any questions on the basics of the approach?
:::


## {background-image="Images/10-1-cartoon_measuring_smoke_stack.jpg"}

::: notes

Last week we explored this approach to environmental problem-solving using case studies, opinion pieces and reviews of empirical research.

### Bottom line, what do we, as policy-designers, need to keep in mind if we chose to address an environmental problem with command and control type regulations?

<br>

- Piggy-back on established institutions for support in oversight and enforcement

- Useful especially if the problem is particularly dangerous or time horizons are VERY long

- Be careful of economy wide effects (overall effect on the economy is hard to predict, could grow or shrink depending on many other factors involved)
    - Must be paired with assistance for impacted workers?

- Be careful of political interests in the design (lobbying and/or protection of well connected industries)

- Regulations have got to keep up with changes in the market and technology (no drift!)

- Depends on balance of "dirty" vs "clean" industries in the target economy

- C&C most realistic if changes are small OR industries carefully targeted?

- Enforcement at the individual level is hard if community doesn't buy-in

<br>

### In terms of your projects, is anybody leaning towards C&C so far? Why?

<br>

### Has anybody ruled it out completely? Why or why not?
:::


## Policy Design: "Green" Taxes {background-image="Images/11-1-Green_taxation_v2.png"}

::: notes

This week we shift to your next policy design option: "Green" taxation policies ([12.3 Market-Oriented Environmental Tools (OpenStax 2016)](https://openstax.org/books/principles-economics-3e/pages/12-3-market-oriented-environmental-tools))

<br>

Let's talk textbook treatment of the approach first.

- Note that the textbook chapter also explores marketable permits and property rights as other ways to use the market to address pollution.

- We'll focus this week just on the tax piece: "Pollution Charges"

<br>

### In super broad strokes, what does it mean to use a tax to address an environmental problem?

- (Apply a charge to some behavior (emitting pollution) forcing the polluter to consider cutting back on those emissions)

- (Instead of mandating a specific technology or emissions limit with a rule, use a tax to make some of the costs of the pollution you create part of your production function)  

<br>

Like last week, let's walk through some of the key elements of this mechanism before we dig into the political arguments about it.

  annotate("segment", x = 0, xend = 100, y = 15, yend = 65, color = "grey", size = 1.3)
```

::: notes

Let's root ourselves back in the logic of how a C&C regulation increases the marginal costs of production.

- The key here is that our C&C regulations are essentially treating all factories the same way

- Every polluter must limit their emissions or adopt a new technology (e.g. smokestack scrubber X)

<br>

HOWEVER, it turns out that:

1. Not every factory has the same slope on their supply curve, and 

2. It can be really hard for the government to know what the "right" regulation should be

<br>

In a sense, we don't actually care how many widgets a factory makes.

- Our interest is in how much pollution they make and what it would cost to reduce it

This plot represents the pollution behavior of a single firm (e.g. widget factory)

- The x-axis: The amount of pollution emitted

- The y-axis: The price per unit of pollution

::: notes

Let's put our two plots side-by-side so we keep the story clear

<br>

The blue dot on each plot represents the current baseline for the factory

- On the left, the production dot is at the equilibrium between supply and demand

- On the right, the production dot is at 100 units of pollution

<br>

So, we begin this hypothetical with a factory producing 57 widgets and 100 units of pollution

<br>

### Make sense?

  annotate("text", x = 87, y = 30, label = "Marginal cost\nof abatement") +
  ggtitle("The Basics of Taxing Pollution: A Single Firm")
```

::: notes

The first thing we need to estimate is the factory's marginal cost of abatement

- The line tells us how much it costs the factory to reduce its pollution by one unit at a time

<br>
    
Moving from right to left represents the cost of eliminating one more ton of emissions

- e.g. adopt new technology, better processes, swapping components, etc.

- Cost is super low at first, but becomes higher and higher as emissions approach zero.

<br>
    
**SLIDE**: For example...

  annotate("point", x = 75, y = 25, size = 4)
```

::: notes

Each point on the curve is the marginal cost so corresponds to a 1-unit change in pollution

<br>

Example: If we wanted to cut the factory's 75th unit of pollution (e.g. down to 74 units) it would cost $25

<br>

::: notes

At the other end the costs go up dramatically

- Example: If we wanted to cut the factory's 25th unit of pollution (e.g. down to 24 units) it would cost $75

<br>

### Does it make sense that the marginal cost of abatement has a negative slope? Why?

- *Force the class to explain the intuition*

<br>

If this plot is meant to help us think about the costs of pollution then this is only half of the equation.

::: notes

This red line represents the marginal external cost of the pollution.

<br>

### Can anybody tell us what this means? How to read this line?

<br>

The marginal external cost of the pollution estimates the harms done by the factory's pollution
- e.g. smog leading to more asthma cases and heart attacks, river pollution killing fisheries, etc

<br>

### Why is the slope of the line positive?

- The cost is assumed to rise as emissions increase

- A tiny bit of pollution is hardly noticeable, but as it increases so too do the harms

<br>

So, these two lines represent the pollution problem from both the factory and societies' perspectives.

<br>

You will not be shocked to discover that many economists argue our goal should be to reduce pollution to the equilibrium point between these two lines!

Back to our starting point: A factory producing at the equilibrium between supply and demand.

<br>

### Who is currently paying the costs for this factory's pollution?

- (Society is paying the cost for ALL of the factory's pollution up to the 100th ton at a cost of $100)

- The factory is paying nothing for dealing with its pollution

- The definition of a negative externality

Imagine we place a $25 tax on EVERY ton of pollution produced by this factory.

- Here I'm focusing just on the effect of the tax on the factory as determined by its marginal cost of abatement.

<br>

Remember, we're beginning at our baseline which is that the factory is emitting 100 units of pollution.

- Thinking through the effect of this tax requires us to remember that these are MARGINAL cost curves

- e.g. the cost to reduce each one unit of pollution

<br>

### So, according to this marginal cost of abatement curve, how much does it cost for the factory to reduce its pollution by 1 unit (e.g. move from 100 to 99 units)?

::: notes

We can follow this logic to this point.

- Up to this point it is cheaper to improve your factory rather than pay the tax

<br>

However, beyond this point the trade-off flips

- In order to cut your pollution from 75 units to 74 units presents a choice of either paying the government $25 or spending $26 to clean up your factory more.

- From this point forward the tax is cheaper than improving your factory and we expect the cuts to stop

Here I'm showing you how the factory's pollution level determines the harms done to society.

- As we noted previously, we're starting from a baseline production level of 100 units of pollution

### So, to be clear, how much benefit does society receive from the factory reducing pollution by only 1 unit? (e.g. move from 100 down to 99 units)

::: notes

Area of a triangle = (base * height)/2

A 1 unit decrease at the highest level is worth $100!

<br>

Remember this is a marginal cost curve

- Society pays $100 for the 100th unit and $99 for the 99th unit

- If we don't have the 100th unit of pollution, we don't pay the extra $100 of costs

<br>

This is the direct reverse of what the factory faces at this end of the curve

::: notes

This presents the societal trade-off in stark terms

<br>

At the extreme end of the pollution curve the choice is a simple one

- The factory can cut the 100th unit of its pollution down to 99 units for only $1

- Doing that removes the 100th unit of pollution which currently imposes $100 in harms on our community!

- That's a trade of $1 for the factory to get $100 for society!

::: notes

That brings us full circle to the result of a $25 "green" tax operating on the factory

- At this level the factory emits 75 units of pollution and society pays $75 in costs for that final unit of pollution

<br>

### Why is this a worse outcome for society than pushing both dots to the equlibrium point?

### - In other words, why is a $25 pollution tax not big enough?

<br>

You can see it clearly in the costs on the y-axis

- At the 75th unit of pollution the factory pays $25 BUT society pays $75!

- In other words, this tax treats the factory as THREE times more valuable than society

<br>

This set-up encourages us to think about how every widget the factory produces is actually paid for BOTH by society AND by the factory!

- This means not applying a tax or setting a very low tax is explicitly deciding that society matters less than a widget factory.

::: notes

The $25 pollution tax leaves society accepting 3x the harms of the benefits being created.

- So, we impose a $75 per unit tax on pollution and cut 75 units of pollution!

<br>

At each step from 100 units of pollution down to 25 the cost of improving your factory is less than the tax

- So you invest in your factory and society gets less pollution.

### Why would economists argue that this is equally "wrong" as a policy outcome?

### - Why does the market wisdom object to this balance of costs and benefits?

<br>

We've reversed the imbalance, but haven't necessarily made things any better!

- Remember, the production of the factory is needed for the local economy to function!
    - The factory means jobs, growth, tax dollars for public goods, etc.

- In terms of economic efficiency, the factory is now spending WAY more on harm reduction than society will benefit.
    - At this level of pollution tax the factory is paying $3 in costs to provide society only $1 in benefit!

::: notes

Early 20th century British economist Arthur Pigou proposed a tax focused on the equilibrium point between these two curves.

- A Pigovian tax reduces the externality to the point where the marginal costs to society equals the marginal costs to the factory.

- Anywhere to the right of that point, the harms to society outweigh the benefits to the factory.

- Anywhere to the left of the intersection, it would cost more to eliminate a ton of emissions than the harm that additional ton would cause.

<br>

Pigou's aim was achieving an "efficient" economic outcome when determining the "optimal" pollution level in our community.

### Questions on the task?

- Go!

- *PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

FIRST, estimating marginal costs curves is REALLY hard
- What is the value of a human life?

- What is the value of enabling someone to get a job?

- Is it likely the two sides will agree on these definitions?

<br>

SECOND, is $1 of societal harm always worth $1 of economic benefit?
- e.g. is the value of one more beanie baby equal to five more childhood asthma cases?

<br>

THIRD, what about inequality in the distribution of the harms?
- Where is this factory located? 

- WHO is doing the suffering?

<br>

FOURTH, what if the marginal external cost curve is not linear?
- This curve assumes an unending Earth, but...

- What about tipping points and irreversibilities?

## "Green" Tax Case Study: The Gas Tax {background-image="Images/08-1-springfield_bike_trail_v3.png"}

::: notes

As a case study, let's talk about the "green" tax you probably experience the most: the gasoline tax

- This refers to the taxes you pay for every gallon of gas you buy

- To be clear, this tax impacts everyone not just those who own a car

- Your groceries and Amazon deliveries all move by truck, trucks use gas and so the prices you pay for everything are impacted

<br>

### What is the policy justification typically made for gasoline taxes?

### - In other words, how do governments typically frame driving as a public problem requiring a collective decisions (e.g. a tax)?

<br>

Gas taxes are frequently justified as a "use" tax

- Driving on the roads damages them so those who drive the most (use the most gas), should pay the most in upkeep

- This is why diesel trucks almost always pay higher tax rates (they do more damage to the roads)

::: notes

This "use" tax problem framing is different from the logic we have been exploring so far in class.

<br>

### Refresh my memory, what is the argument for a gasoline tax focusing on the MC_E and MC_A curves?
- (Aim is to balance the costs to the driver with the harms done to society)

- In green tax logic it is meant to force you to consider some of the social harms caused by your car when deciding how much to drive.

<br>

### Big picture, what options does a person have for reducing the amount of the tax they pay?

- *ON BOARD*

- More efficiency: Buy a hybrid or electric vehicle

- Drive less
    - Public Transit
    - Carpool
    - Bike, scooter, walk

- Use less stuff / buy local
    
<br>

What I hope you can see from this list is the options are varied in terms of their appeal to you personally.

- This is an important point we need to dig into

::: notes

What I'd like each of you to do is to draw your personal marginal cost of abatement curve

- e.g. I want you to estimate how sensitive you personally would be to increases in the gas tax

<br>

I've tweaked the plot axes to make this a little easier for you

- The x-axis tracks the amount you drive as a proportion of your baseline (e.g. current driving)
      - For those who don't have a car, feel free to keep this hypothetical

- The y-axis is a gasoline tax for every amount from $0 to 10$ per gallon

<br>

### To clarify this, what would your marginal cost curve look like if you were insensitive to price?

### - e.g. you plan on driving 100% of your baseline NO MATTER WHAT?

::: notes

Add these together and you have a 42.9 cent "green" tax applied to every gallon of gas you buy in Missouri.

### Per your marginal cost of abatement curves, how much does this 43 cent tax reduce your personal driving habits?

<br>

### What does our current tax rate imply about who pays most of the costs for your driving? 

### - Is it you or is it society?

<br>

### If it is society, why is that the right policy choice?

<br>

How on Earth do low gas taxes get presented as the choice that is more pro-freedom? Blows my mind.

- Such an important example of how winning the "collective decision" argument is a powerful strategy for stopping environmental problem-solving

<br>

So, does any state in the US do this better than Missouri?

### Any idea where that 24 cents per gallon puts Missouri nationally?

### - Where do we rank compared to other states?

Big Takeaways (so far)

<br>

FIRST, UNLIKE supply and demand, the pollution equilibrium is NOT self-enforcing.
- Balancing the costs to the polluter and the wider society REQUIRES government action.

<br>

SECOND, EVERYONE has a different MC_a! 
-Different resources (wealth), different access to public transit, different proximity to work and shopping, different pressures (sick family member needing to get to a distant hospital)

<br>

**SLIDE**: These individual differences are what make "green" taxes such a useful policy option

[Carbon Pricing and Regulations Compared: An Economic Explainer by the Niskanen Center](https://www.niskanencenter.org/carbon-pricing-and-regulations-compared-an-economic-explainer/)

<br>

Let's simultaneously examine a country with two factories (econspeak = firms)

<br>

Key 1: Both firms have identical marginal external cost curves (e.g. their pollution impacts society in the same ways)

<br>

Key 2: HOWEVER, the firms have very different abatement curves.

- Firm 1 emits less pollution and can cut pollution more cheaply than Firm 2

<br>

**Remember, according to the "markets" wisdom the goal is to achieve pollution cuts while minimizing harms to our economy!**

In a world without regulations or taxes each firm produces as many widgets as it thinks it can sell profitably

- e.g. Produce at the equilibrium point between supply and demand

<br>

At the baseline:

- Our society is paying the costs for 200 units of pollution (Firm 1 75, Firm 2 125)

- The firms are paying nothing for these harms

<br>

### Everybody understand these calculations?

<br>

Let's now set a policy goal of cutting the pollution hitting society in half

- e.g. Go down from 200 to 100 units of pollution from these two factories

::: notes

Option 1: Let's implement a command and control regulation of 50 units of pollution per factory.

- e.g. No factory is permitted to emit more than 50 units of pollution (50 + 50 = 100!)

<br>

Here we see the results of this regulation.

- The area of the blue triangle is the cost of abatement to each firm.

<br>

### What can you tell me from these plots?

1. This policy succeeds in cutting emissions in half
    - Remember, the baseline was 200 units of pollution total

2. The Firms collectively pay north of $3k in abatement costs
    - Money not spent in production, e.g. lost to our economy

3. The Firm with the harder production to clean up is forced to implement way more cuts.
    - Not captured in these figures but this likely means a big negative impact to the economy

As an alternative, imagine an INCREDIBLY complicated regulation that aims to implement an absolute cut to EVERY individual firm's equilibrium point.

- This regulation is almost certainly IMPOSSIBLE to write, BUT...

<br>

### What's the effect of this "market perfect" regulation?

- This policy ALSO succeeds in cutting the emissions in half, and

- Abatement costs cut DRAMATICALLY!
    - 3,113 - 2,656 = $457!
    
<br>
    
### Is everybody clear on how this is "better" but likely impossible?

- Requires information from each Firm they may not have or be willing to share, and

- Requires concrete measures of societal harms we definitely don't have and everyone would argue about
    - What is the cost of 1 asthma case or 1 heart attack prevented?

::: notes

Here we've chosen to implement a $50 per unit "green" tax on pollution

<br>

### Ok, what happened here?

### - What do you see in these triangle sizes?

<br>

The tax creates an incentive to innovate and get more efficient!

- This means that a well designed tax can get us to the same level of abatement as a firm cut, but at MUCH lower cost to the economy!

<br>

We don't end up cutting to the equilibrium points but instead the tax finds the cheapest places to cut across all the firms!

- Remember, cuts and abatement costs represent real pain to real people in our community.

- Pollution cuts are important but ideally we should achieve them at the lowest pain possible, right?

::: notes

Designing a tax means using the power of the market to reduce pollution.

<br>

Markets move MUCH faster and more efficiently to produce profits than top-down regulators possibly can.

- The key is that the tax makes finding a way to pollute less during production a profit-maximizing decision.

- If you make "being green" profitable then the market will take care of it for you.

<br>

Regulations are hard to design and are inflexible by design

- Everyone must hit a certain cap or use a specific technology

- While the cap can inspire innovation, technology standards rarely do

<br>

For today I gave you a series of readings that aim to pitch you the pros and cons of "green" taxes.

- I'd like to explore those arguments, but by focusing on our discussion of gasoline taxes

## $5 Gas Tax vs No Gas Cars < 4 miles {background-image="Images/08-1-springfield_bike_trail_v3.png"}

::: notes

I would like you to help me evaluate two policy designs meant to reduce pollution levels in metro Springfield

- Option 1: We implement a $5 per gallon gasoline tax

- Option 2: We forbid the use of gasoline powered cars for any trip less than four miles long (so public transit, bikes, walking, escooters, electric vehicles)

<br>

Talk to the people around you, consider both options and then report back on which plan you think we should implement and why.

- Go!

<br>

*REPORT back and DISCUSS*

<br>

### - Which cuts pollution faster?

### - Which provides greater flexibility?

### - Which policy reinforces inequality more?

### - Which policy is cheaper/easier to implement?

<br>

## Policy Design: "Green" Taxes {background-image="Images/11-1-Green_taxation_v2.png"}

::: notes

### Having discussed those two arguments and thought about the gas tax some more, where do you end up on the gas tax vs C&C regulation debate?

### - Any early takeaways on how you would decide between these two design options?

*Force this discussion*

## Assignment for Thursday {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png"  .center}

<br>

Submit to Canvas a real world example of **this approach** being used to **successfully** address an environmental problem **similar to the one in your project**.

**Present as an argument**: This case shows that addressing environmental problem X can be done successfully using "green" taxes.

::: notes

Thursday we repeat our model from last week!

- Everybody submit evidence and an argument to Canvas for class on Thursday!
