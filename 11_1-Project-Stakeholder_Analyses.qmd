Prep for Class

1. Record Canvas submissions

This week we focus on writing and revising your first paper.

::: notes

The layout of the class is designed to give you a crash course in applied public policy-making in the "environmental" arena

- Each piece of this builds on the ones before it

<br>

The ultimate goal is to produce a compelling and usable policy proposal to address a local environmental problem

- So far, our work has focused on attendance and participation so you can learn the concepts and tools we need

- **SLIDE**: This week we segue to your first paper so you can clarify and explain the political baseline of your problem
:::

::: notes

Paper 1 is meant to help you clarify and be able to explain the political baseline of your problem

- This means presenting your problem in terms of the material we've covered on politics, policy and the environment

<br>

Why set up our projects this way?

1. First, this baseline helps ensure that your project is being built on a strong foundation, and

2. Second, this baseline is key to you being an effective problem-solver in the case

<br>

**SLIDE**: So, what do we mean by the "politics" of your problem?

:::

**"Politics" means your problem is the result of...**

<br>

- Actors pursuing their interests,

- Colliding with other actors doing the same thing,

- In an established system of rules and expectations (community)
:::
::::

::: notes

*Read slide*

<br>

An effective problem-solver needs to be able to:

<br>

1) Design problem-framings that do not depend on villainizing stakeholders
- There are no villains in your problem, just people or groups pursuing the things they want

<br>

2) Design problem-framings that are adapted to real communities
- There is no blank slate, we live in a community whose rules, identities and processes shape our interactions

<br>

**SLIDE**: Enough preamble, let's talk assignment details
:::



## Paper 1 {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

**Introducing the Problem**

<br>

Your report **must** include:

1. A description of the **scientific basis** for your problem,

2. An argument that this is a **public problem**,

3. An argument that this requires a **collective decision**, and

4. An analysis of **at least two stakeholders** with **opposing** viewpoints of the problem

::: notes

Your first paper introduces an interested reader to the political baseline of your local environmental problem

- This description is posted on Canvas with additional details

- Please see the "Paper Submission Requirements" in the syllabus

<br>

1) At this point I expect you each have a good sense of the scientific basis for your problem
- For the paper you need to be able to explain this in detail and provide evidence of your claims

<br>

2) At this point I expect you each have drafted and revised a version of your framing argument (e.g. public problem and collective decision)
- This also needs evidence to elevate it beyond your opinion!

<br>

We will work in class today on your stakeholder analyses
- e.g. Who are they, what do they want and how do they frame the problem?

<br>

### Questions on the paper before we get to work?

::: notes

For today everybody identified and began to analyze two stakeholders with opposing viewpoints on their environmental problem.

<br>

In class I am going to give you time to flesh out these analyses and get feedback from the class on them.

<br>

In short, for each stakeholder I would like you to produce a summary document presenting and analyzing their role in your problem

- Please write in complete sentences so you can share what you produce

:::



## Analyze your First Stakeholder {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.incremental}
1) Who are they and why did you pick them?

2) How do they frame the problem? (e.g. primary causes, public or private, collective or individual, etc.)

3) What are the best ways to appeal to this stakeholder?

4) What are the deal-breakers for this stakeholder?
:::

::: notes

Let's get your analysis down on the page (electronic or paper) for **ONE** of your stakeholders.

<br>

1) First, describe the actor (e.g. individual, group, organization, corporation, etc), and

- Describe your thinking in picking them

<br>

2) Second, describe the problem framing
- What do they think is the primary or most important cause of this "problem"?

- Public or private problem? e.g. individual action causes public harm vs doesn't

- Collective or individual decision? e.g. society should decide vs Individuals should decide

<br>

3) Third, what do they value?
- Based on all you've written so far, what do you think is the most promising ways to reach out to this stakeholder and get them on board with solving your problem?

<br>

4) Finally, what are the clear lines they are unlikely to cross?
- Values they hold deeply?

- Core interests that motivate them?

<br>
    
### Questions on this?

- Everybody take 15 minutes to write this document

<br>

*As people finish, get them to share analyses with each other!*

- Go share. Give and get feedback!

- Are you convinced we understand enough about this stakeholder to influence them? Why or why not?

- What additional evidence would help us either understand them or demonstrate that our analyses of them are sufficiently credible?

:::



## Analyze your Second Stakeholder {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

1) Who are they and why did you pick them?

2) How do they frame the problem? (e.g. primary causes, public or private, collective or individual, etc.)

3) What are the best ways to appeal to this stakeholder?

4) What are the deal-breakers for this stakeholder?

::: notes

Alright, let's do it again!

- Take 15 minutes to write up your analysis of the second stakeholder

<br>

*As people finish, get them to share analyses with each other!*

- Go share. Give and get feedback!

- Are you convinced we understand enough about this stakeholder to influence them? Why or why not?

- What additional evidence would help us either understand them or demonstrate that our analyses of them are sufficiently credible?
:::




## What problem framing could exist that both stakeholders would accept? {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: notes

Last step for today.

- Take a step back from your two detailed analyses

- Can you identify areas of overlap between the framings of these two stakeholders?

<br>

Take a few minutes to brainstorm an overlapping frame.

- Can you propose a problem framing that both stakeholders would accept?

<br>

*SHARE and PRESENT each*
