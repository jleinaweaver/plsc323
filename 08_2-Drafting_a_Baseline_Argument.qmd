Tons of good news for you!

- Tuesday after break, no class! You're welcome!

- Thursday after break we get to volunteer at OFH's distribution center

<br>

**REVEAL**

- Very much an organization working to promote social justice and address serious environmental challenges in our community

- An excellent organization and I'm looking forward to working with them again

<br>

**Questions on our field trip?**

- There's a release form you'll have to sign and I'll get that to you soon

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, back to our work this week

::: notes

As we discussed last class we are now shifting from identifying environmental problems to analyzing them

- Last class we heard a bunch of different pressing local problems that need our attention

<br>

**SLIDE**: For today

:::



## For Today {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

Pick **ONE** local environmental problem and submit to Canvas:

1. Define the problem

2. Argue: This is an IMPORTANT problem

3. Argue: This is a PUBLIC problem

4. Argue: This problem requires a COLLECTIVE decision

::: notes

For today I asked each of you to select a local environmental problem and then brainstorm the basic elements of an argument that we must act on it!

<br>

**How did this go?**

- **Any difficulty differentiating between these three inter-related elements?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: This exercise is meant to get you ready for our next assignment!

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Baseline Argument Report (30pts, due Mar 20)**
:::

- Submit an argument paper advancing a central thesis that we have an important, public environmental problem to address in our community.

::: notes

After the break you will submit an argument paper version of the work you started on Canvas for class today

<br>

This is the big picture aim of that paper

- I am looking for you to write a simple argument paper

- Your job will be to convince the reader that you have selected an important, public environmental problem that requires a collective decision to improve.

<br>

Your work on the assignment for today explicitly mirrors what I want from this paper

- This means you have a huge jumpstart on this exercise!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's talk details!

**Baseline Argument Report (30pts, due Mar 20)**
:::

- Thesis: X is an important, public environmental problem we need to address in our community.

::: {.incremental}

- Five-paragraph essay (e.g. intro, body and conclusion)

- Body: Three premises you drafted for today

- All claims of fact require evidence; all evidence requires in-text APA citations and a bibliography

- Minimum of 900 words (not counting the bibliography)

:::

::: notes

Let's be super prescriptive with this

- I want everyone to adopt a version of this sentence as the thesis of their paper

- This is NOT an exercise in poetry, it is an exercise in writing a clear and compelling argument

<br>

Other key elements of the assignment:

- **REVEAL x 4**

**Any questions on the assignment or the required elements I am specifying here?**

Canvas ASSIGNMENT: Baseline Argument Report (30pts, due Mar 20)

Submit an argument paper advancing a central thesis that we have an important, public environmental problem to address in our community.

- This paper should be structured as a simple, five-paragraph essay with an introduction, a body consisting of three premises and a conclusion
	  - Premise 1 - This is an important problem
- Premise 2 - This is a public problem
- Premise 3 - The problem should be addressed collectively
- Each premise gets one paragraph in the body of the paper in order to explain the premise and support it with evidence
- All evidence must be cited using APA formatted in-text citations and you must include a bibliography at the end of the paper
- The paper must be a minimum of 900 words (not counting the bibliography)

:::



## The Body of the Paper {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

- Premise 1: This is an IMPORTANT problem

- Premise 2: This is a PUBLIC problem

- Premise 3: This problem requires a COLLECTIVE decision

<br>

**Each** premise must be **clearly explained** and supported by **multiple** pieces of high quality evidence!


::: notes

The three short arguments you submitted to Canvas represent a rough draft of the body of your paper

- I'd now like each of you to read EVERYBODY elses draft in class

- Go see how other people are tackling this exercise

<br>

The aim is to get and give feedback!

- Help the writer identify the parts of the argument that are not clear enough AND the parts that need more evidence!

<br>

**Questions?**

- Go!

<br>

**SLIDE**: the assignment

<br>

Canvas ASSIGNMENT: Drafting an Argument for Action (15pts)

Pick ONE local environmental problem and submit the following:

1. A thesis statement: Define your selected local, environmental problem as clearly as you can. Keep Hughes' (2007) advice in mind and don't define the problem using your preferred strategy. 
2. Make an argument that this is an IMPORTANT problem (4-5 sentences)
3. Make an argument that this is a PUBLIC problem (per Munger (2000), 4-5 sentences)
4. Make an argument that this problem requires a COLLECTIVE decision (per Munger (2000), 4-5 sentences)
NOTES: These three arguments are certainly related to each other, but your job is to keep them distinct. Your over-arching argument needs to convince the reader that your problem is important, that specific individual choices impact community welfare, and that we require a community decision to address it.
