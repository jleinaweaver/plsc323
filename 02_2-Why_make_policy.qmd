::: notes

We have simulated a resource management problem, debated the concept of wilderness and turned our analytical eye to Drury's campus.

- Each of these was meant to help set the table for community problem-solving

<br>

**What was the intended lesson of our simulation game?**

- **What did I ask you to remember from this experience?**

<br>

The Lesson: Politics in everything!

- EVERY problem exists in a community and EVERY community is a mix of actors & expectations

- This means that new rules and processes must be adapted to the rules and processes already in place

- You guys were eager to jump to murder as a means for enforcing the rules which means that trust is a vital component of creating rules that will work

<br>

**For the purposes of problem-solving, what is "the trouble with wilderness" and what do we need to keep in mind as we work?**

1. The "environment" is a contested concept and its meaning over time has been fluid

2. The root of many "environmental" conflicts is often a conflict in definitions

3. A good problem-solver must be flexible and adaptable which means not locking in on any single definition!

<br>

**What were your takeaways from evaluating Drury's campus in environmental terms?**

- **What is Drury doing well?**

- **What do we need to do better?**

<br>

For me the lesson is twofold:

- There is wildness to be fostered **EVERYWHERE**, SO

- Stop waiting for an invitation to **GET INVOLVED**

<br>

## Our Aim for Today {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Argument: Problem-solving in a community requires policy**
:::

![](Images/03_1-Public-Policy-Research.jpg){.absolute bottom=25 left=100 width="800"}

::: notes

For today I assigned you a chapter from Michael Munger's *Analyzing Policy* book

- Munger's book is an excellent read for anyone interested in becoming a policy analyst or policymaker.

- Munger makes a series of arguments about policymaking that I want us to unpack together and reflect upon

<br>

**Let's set the table first in a big picture way. When you hear the word "policy," what immediately springs to mind?**

- **What are the "policy" examples that you've encountered?**

<br>

- (Laws and regulations by government)

- (Rules for behavior as a student at Drury)

- (Rules tied to your contract with your employer at work)

- (The class syllabus!)

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's start where Munger does

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

![](Images/02-1-Burke_Quote.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Munger kicks off his chapter with a longer version of this quote.

- "Government is a contrivance of human wisdom to provide for human wants. Men have a right that these wants should be provided for by this wisdom" (Edmund Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France, November 1790).

<br>

**What do you think of this as a definition of "government" or the purpose of "government"?**

- **By these terms, were you a government during our fishing simulation?**

<br>

Burke frames government as a human effort to deliver what we want

- Burke acknowledges that government is not "god-given" or part of the "natural order", it is a device built by us to achieve specific aims

- "contrivance": "the use of skill to bring something about or create something" (OED)

<br>

Importantly, this means that "government" is not impartial, perfect, or fixed in nature

- Governing is really hard.

- It is a human operation run by a community to achieve the goals of that community.

- In the simulation you were doing your best to manage a bunch of interests in the face of great uncertainty!

<br>

**SLIDE**: And I can't help but go from this to...

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

![](Images/02-1-Murray-make-a-difference.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Even MORE importantly, this means government is not separate from you.

- It is not a building far away or a special class of people

- It is the confusing name we apply to our community's efforts to solve problems

<br>

We live in a big, complicated country and its functioning well depends on you

- Problem-solving is in your hands

- The "decider" can be anyone, or any group, willing to put in the work 

- If you design a plan that meets the needs of its stakeholders and the conditions on the ground, you can make a difference

- THIS is how our government is designed to work

<br>

This is why we work on local environmental problems in here

- I want us tied to a specific community, in a specific moment in time and at a level where we can find concrete ways to make a difference.

<br>

**Questions on this?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: One other important baseline we need for working on policy

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**EVERY policy creates winners and losers**
:::

![](Images/02-1-winners.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Never forget, however, that in real-world problem-solving we play with live ammunition (so to speak)

<br>

Policy designers must NEVER forget that **all policies create winners and losers**.

+ Policy-making is **ALWAYS a choice** and **all choices have consequences**.

<br>

For example, Missouri just raised its minimum wage

- **Who benefits from increases to the minimum wage?**

- **Who pays the costs for those increases?**

- **Is there any way to pay workers more without distributing the costs to society?**

<br>

The same is true with environmental policies

- Take the clean air standards set by the Clean Air Act and the EPA

- **Who benefits from cleaner air?**

- **And who pays the costs for it?**

- **Is there any way to get cleaner air without impacting polluting industries?**

<br>

**Humor me, can we think of any policy or rule in our society whether implemented by government, school, or your employer, that does not impose costs on someone?**

<br>

So, policy is, in essence, a rule or rules adopted by a society to structure behavior.

- All rules impose costs on some and provide benefits to others

- Policy-making is often an exercise in deciding who will pay the costs and who will receive the benefits.

<br>

Ok, so:

1. Government is the label we apply to efforts by human societies to provide for the needs of their own community, and

2. EVERY policy is designed to help someone but inevitably hurts someone else

<br>

Then the question must become, why can't we get the positive ends without the negatives

- **SLIDE**: Let's indulge the libertarian fantasy!

:::


## {background-image="Images/02-1-cavemen.jpg" .center}

::: notes

Let's start with Munger's discussion of the hypothetical Hun-gats tribe (p40-47)

- This is absolutely one of my favorite thought experiments

<br>

Talk to me about the tribe. 

- **What details stood out for you in this thought experiment?**

<br>

**What dilemma was the tribe facing?**

- (A tribe of hunter-gatherers in pre-history that are running out of food (or at least the food they know is safe to eat))

**What options were available to them and what were the pros and cons of each?**

- (Option: They can stay independent and "free" (every man for himself), but that will almost certainly wipe them out)

- (Option: Create policy to share risk and increase chances of survival over time)

**Are you convinced there is no reasonable individual path to survival for the Hungats? Why or why not?**

<br>

**Why is Munger telling us this story?**

- **What does he hope aspiring policy analysts will learn from this?**

- (**SLIDE**: *These bullets on next slide*)
    1. There was never a "state of nature"
    2. Survival makes policy a necessity
    3. Battles over expertise are unavoidable
    4. Policy effectiveness depends on authority

**The Lessons of the Hun-gats**

1. There was never a "state of nature"

2. Survival makes policy a necessity

3. Battles over expertise are unavoidable

4. Policy effectiveness depends on authority

:::
::::

::: notes

**REVEAL 1**: The "state of nature" baseline is probably a stupid one as it never could have existed (not even in this thought experiment)

<br>

Think back to our simulation on the first day of class.

- Most of you were strangers to each other when we played the game and yet your behavior was HEAVILY influenced by:

    - Your individual expectations for how you will do in this class (e.g. is EC valuable or not?),

    - Your individual needs for progress towards your longer-term goals (graduation, grad school, etc)

    - Your desire to be seen by the rest of the group in a particular way (classmates and professor)

    - Your sense of how classrooms in college are supposed to function (e.g. what are the rules of behavior?)

    - Your desire (maybe?) to not exterminate a species

    - and so much more...

<br>

There is no "starting from scratch" anywhere in human societies!

- All new policies are built on top of a mess of established policies and there's no avoiding that

<br>

**REVEAL 2**: Survival odds are maximized by sharing risks and benefits in a community

- Community's require rules to function

- Socialism for the win, eh?

<br>

**REVEAL 3**: Battles over expertise are central to policy-making

- There is no single, perfect standard for evaluating outcomes

- Different perspectives and interests will prefer different standards

<br>

**REVEAL 4**: Policy can only ever be as effective as the authority that compels the behavior, e.g. the birth of religious rules?

<br>

**Is everybody clear on these four "lessons"?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Alright, let's get more precise in defining our key terms

:::




## What is Policy? {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

"A definite course or method of action selected (as by a government, institution, group or individual) from among alternatives and in the light of given conditions to guide and usually determine present and future decisions..." (Webster's Third International Dictionary).

::: notes

I don't present this as the "right" or "correct" definition of policy

- Instead, this is a clear definition that takes a position on a few key elements I want us to highlight

<br>

**SLIDE**: Policy is a concrete action

:::



## What is Policy? {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

"A [**definite course or method of action**]{style="color:blue;"} selected (as by a government, institution, group or individual) from among alternatives and in the light of given conditions to guide and usually determine present and future decisions..." (Webster's Third International Dictionary).

::: notes

1) A policy, by definition, is a "definite" "course" or "method" of action

<br>

Think of this like creating a rule of behavior

- Without specificity and clarity the policy cannot hope to change behavior because no one will know what has changed

- e.g. Actor X must do Y

- e.g. Companies investing in new equipment must...

<br>

**SLIDE**: The alternatives
:::



## What is Policy? {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

"A definite course or method of action selected (as by a government, institution, group or individual) [**from among alternatives**]{style="color:blue;"} and in the light of given conditions to guide and usually determine present and future decisions..." (Webster's Third International Dictionary).

::: notes

This inclusion is excellent but also seems more proscriptive than descriptive

- In other words, I agree that effective policy should be selected from among competing options

- There is NEVER just one answer to an environmental problem

- BUT that seems more like advice to making good policy rather than defining policy

<br>

Either way, I like making it definitional here

- Let's set out to do good work and not just "work"

- The power of defining a concept in action!

<br>

This means I want you to think about ALL policy as choosing one set of rules over another

- Effective problem-solvers MUST be able to explain their choices in the context of the policies not selected

- In other words, you will be expected to have explicitly considered alternatives to your "definite" "course of action" AND be able to explain why you choose the way you did

<br>

**Make sense?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: conditions matter
:::

    

## What is Policy? {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

"A definite course or method of action selected (as by a government, institution, group or individual) from among alternatives and [**in the light of given conditions**]{style="color:blue;"} to guide and usually determine present and future decisions..." (Webster's Third International Dictionary).

::: notes

3) A policy, by definition, must be adapted to the important "conditions" of the problem

- In other words, the quality of your plan also DEPENDS on how well you've adapted it to the conditions on the ground.

- No one-size-fits-all policy solutions are appropriate here.

<br>

This seems like another piece of advice rather than a simple definition

- But I love this advice too so let's keep it!


<br>

THIS is the danger of groups tied or committed to a specific ideology.

- Both cutting regulations and adding new ones are powerful options for influencing behavior, BUT

- It is the context of the problem that should guide your policy design, not vice versa!

- If you know the policy answer before you hear the problem you are not taking it seriously

<br>

**SLIDE**: stakeholders matter
:::

::: notes

4) A policy, by definition, "guide[s]" or "determine[s]" future behavior by stakeholders

- Stakeholders e.g. the people involved in the problem

<br>

And now we're back to the definition rather than the advice

- If your rule is sufficiently clear then it will move behavior now AND guide future behavior too!

<br>

**SLIDE**: In sum
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

### To maximize your chances of success, your policy proposals must be:

::: {.r-fit-text}
- Specific,

- Adapted to the stakeholders,

- Adapted to the science of the problem, 

- Adapted to the rules of the community, and

- Be at least as good as the alternatives.
:::

::: notes
**Does all of that make sense?**

<br>

Everybody write this down and consider it a guide for our work this semester and especially for the final paper!

<br>

**Ok any questions about defining policy or the elements of "good" policy we've been discussing?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's now shift to the next important piece of the Munger chapter and that is thinking about the policy-making process

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

### Problem-solving in a community requires policy, but policymaking has pre-requisites!


![](Images/02-1-Munger_Fig2-3.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Just because you now accept that a problem is serious and needs policy to address it, doesn't mean the community is on board!

- In Figure 2.3 Munger lays out his "three stages of policy choice"

- aka "Deciding How to Decide"

<br>

In essence, Munger's three steps are:

1. Convince the community that there is a problem,

2. Convince the community that it should be addressed collectively, and

3. Convince the community of how the specific policy should be adopted

<br>

Fundamentally, this figure is a reminder for ALL policymakers: **BEFORE you try to solve ANY problem, you MUST make a number of convincing arguments**

<br>

**SLIDE**: For our purposes, I'm going to boil these down to two distinct steps I'm describing as the pre-requisites of policy

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Policymaking Pre-Requisites**

<br>

You must convince the community that:

1. We have a public problem, and

2. We require a collective decision to solve it
:::

::: notes

Each pre-requisite is a distinct argument that you have to successfully make before moving to any actual policy-design

<br>

In other words, before we can debate rules, new taxes, subsidies or anything else you first must succeed in convincing the community that collective action is needed.

- This is NOT an easy step, but the better you do this the easier the rest of the process becomes.

<br>

Let's start with the first of these

- **SLIDE**: What does it mean to argue that we have a public problem?

:::



## Policymaking Pre-Requisite 1 {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Private Problem**

- "My choice has no consequence for your welfare"

**Public Problem**

- "My choices affect your welfare"

:::

::: notes

First you must establish who is being impacted by the choices that are creating the problem, as you see it

- Note that for clarity I am referring to these as debates about the "problem" instead of "decisions" as Munger does in the chapter

<br>

**Give me an example of something in your life that is clearly a "private problem" by this definition.**

<br>

**Now give me an example of something in your life that is clearly a "public problem" by this definition.**

<br>

**How distinct are these two things?**

- **Is it likely the case that people easily agree the difference between public and private problems?**

<br>

- **Give me an example of a problem that straddles the line between public and private these days**

<br>

Ok, so you've convinced the community that we have a public problem, now what?

- **SLIDE**: Now we make the argument that this problem requires a collective decision to solve it
:::


## Policymaking Pre-Requisite 2 {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Individual Decision**

- "I can choose, alone and without interference"

**Collective Decision**

- "Choices are made by a group, and are binding on all"
:::

::: notes
The second pre-requisite is that you convince the community that this problematic "choice" should be governed by rules set by us all collectively.

<br>

**Give me an example of something in your life that should definitely remain an "individual decision" by this definition.**

<br>

**Now give me an example of something in your life that should absolutely require a "collective decision" by this definition.**

<br>

**How distinct are these two things?**

- **Is it likely the case that people easily agree the difference between individual and collective decision problems?**

<br>

- **Give me an example of a problem that straddles the line**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Set up the practice exercise

:::

1. We have a public problem, and

2. We require a collective decision to solve it
:::

::: notes

**Ok, any questions on the two pre-requisites we must complete?**

<br>

Let's practice making these kinds of arguments

- *Split class into three groups*

- Go sit with your group and claim some space on the board!

**SLIDE**: We're going back to the magical fishery!

:::


## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png"}

![](Images/01_1-cartoon_lake.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Does our magical fishery require public policy?**
:::

- Group 1: Private Problem, Individual Decision

- Group 2: Public Problem, Individual Decision

- Group 3: Public Problem, Collective Decision

::: notes

Each group will have ten minutes to put on the board the strongest argument they can that supports one of three possible answers to this question

- Group 1, your conclusion is that the magical fishery is a private problem that should be left to the individual to manage

- Group 2, your conclusion is that the magical fishery is a public problem, BUT it should still be left to the individual to manage

- Group 3, your conclusion is that the magical fishery is a public problem, AND it should be managed collectively

<br>

**Everybody clear on the job?**

- Go!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

- **What advice can we offer each group to help them strengthen their argument?**

<br>

Ok, groups, now you know the enemy!

- Take some time to reinforce your argument AND to prepare a counter-argument against the other two groups

- **Does everybody understand what I'm asking for?**

- Go!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

**Out of curiosity, and in terms of our fishery, which of these do you find the most convincing? Why?**

- Group 2: The magical fishery is a public problem, BUT it should still be left to the individual to manage

::: notes

Now that we've mapped out the obstacles, our job is to work to overcome them!

<br>

Typically, your first job is to develop consensus in the community around the idea that we have a public problem (not private).

- This means not yet challenging the belief that this is none of your business!

<br>

**Ok, let's brainstorm from strategies for moving someone from Group 1 to Group 2**

- *DISCUSS*

<br>

**Does everybody understand why we start with Group 1 and not Group 2?**

You must convince the community that:

1. We have a public problem, and

2. We require a collective decision to solve it
:::

::: notes

Alright, now we need to evaluate this second big argument.

<br>

**Are you convinced that these are the required pre-requisites for policymaking in a community? Why or why not?**

- **What is the value in mapping out the positions like this before starting policymaking?**

<br>

- **And what is the value in spending time and effort moving the groups BEFORE beginning policymaking?**

<br>

Bottom line, I am convinced that this pre-requisite stage represents incredibly important time spent laying the foundation for future success in a community: 

- Find the stakeholders, learn about their framings, identify obstacles and work to smooth them!

<br>

Next week we perform a comparative case study to help develop our intuitions about why some communities can solve environmental problems and others cannot

- **SLIDE**: We'll kick things off next class with the FAILURES!

:::



## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

Find an example of a **LOCAL** community **FAILING** to solve an environmental problem

::: {.fragment}
- Choosing NOT to create a needed policy,

- Removing or weakening environmental policies, OR

- Persisting with policies that are not working.
:::
::: notes

By local I'm asking you to focus on smaller communities

- e.g. neighborhoods, cities or, at most, counties

<br>

Countries and states often struggle to make policy due to the complexity of their policy-making structures

- This means a failure to solve a problem likely has a million causes completely unrelated to the environment or the needs of the immediate stakeholders

- For example, California often tries to address serious environmental problems that exist entirely within its own borders but is frequently stopped by the Republicans in Congress on ideological grounds or by the Supreme Court on supremacy clause grounds

- Neither of those tell us much about the key policy trade-offs of interest 

<br>

Our focus on smaller communities means we get to zoom in on negotiation dynamics that focus on the environmental problem itself

- A city may decide not to act, but even that decisions will be couched in an evaluation of the problem and its impacts

<br>

**Does that make sense?**

<br>

Ok, what are you looking for?

- **REVEAL**

<br>

Other notes:

- No overlap in cases! (e.g. don't submit a case someone has already submitted)

- On Canvas I will ask you to describe the case and then apply the Munger material to analyze it

<br>

**Questions on the assignment or any of the material from today?**

<br>

Canvas DISCUSSION: Cases Illustrating Local Communities Failing to Solve Environmental Problems (10pts)

Find us an example of a LOCAL community anywhere in the world failing to solve an environmental problem (focus on small communities, cities or counties).  Look for an example of a community unable to make rules to address an environmental problem, a community that removed rules that then led to environmental harm, OR a community whose rules are not working to address an environmental problem. 

- No overlap in cases! (e.g. don't submit a case someone has already submitted)
- Make sure to provide evidence to support your claims (APA citations)

1. Describe the environmental problem they confronted, 
2. Describe the community facing the problem (Who are they? Where are they located? What do they look like demographically?), 
3. What has been the impact of this failure on the community? What harms have been done (or been allowed to continue)?
4. Apply the Munger material to your case: How is this an example of a community choosing to frame this problem as "private" rather than "public"?
5. Apply the Munger material to your case: How is this an example of a community choosing to frame this problem as requiring an "individual" rather than a "collective" decision to address it?

Munger opens the chapter with three of what he describes as "wisdoms" or ways of people might evaluate the "correctness" of a policy

::: notes

**What would it mean to adopt the markets as your primary "wisdom" for policymaking?**

- **In other words, how might a markets-focus be used to solve environmental problems?**

<br>

Preference for allocating resources AND solving problems using systems of private exchange. 

- Concerned primarily with process, less so with outcomes

- Preference for non-interventionist style policies wherever possible

- Rules only to keep that market well functioning (contract enforcement, etc)

<br>

**What would a market-based solution to our magical fishery resource look like?**

- **How many fishers? Who fishes? What about enforcement?**

<br>

**According to the chapter, what are the pros and cons of prioritizing a markets focus over the others?**

Pros: 

- Most efficient by definition (most bang for the resource buck)

<br>

Cons - Market failures such as:

1) Monopolies (e.g. antitrust), 

2) Externalities (e.g. pollution), 

3) Under supply of public goods (e.g. free-riding), and 

4) Information problems (e.g. drug safety); Reduces all problems to maximization of use issues

**What would it mean to adopt expertise as your primary "wisdom" for policymaking?**

- **In other words, how might an experts-based focus prefer we solve environmental problems?**

<br>

Preference for allocating resources AND solving problems emphasizing deeper knowledge of the systems involved. 

- "someone who has the goal of improving the functioning of politics or markets" (31).

- Those systems can be economic, political or scientific.

<br>

**What would an expert driven solution to our magical fishery resource look like?**

- **How many fishers? Who fishes? What about enforcement?**

<br>

**According to the chapter, what are the pros and cons of prioritizing a politics focus over the others?**

Pros: 

- Hopefully relies on transparent and verifiable knowledge; 

- Plans built on expertise and designed with ongoing evaluation

<br>

Cons: 

- May discourage wide participation; 

- May privilege some uses/solutions over others; 

- May lead to inequitable outcomes depending on "who" the experts are

<br>
