Prep for Class

1. Review Canvas submissions

2. Save the final theories brainstormed by class today in slides for next class (3-2) so we can evaluate them with the success cases

<br>

Welcome back all!

- **SLIDE**: We ended last week discussing the lessons of Munger's book chapter on public policy

:::

**Problem-solving in a community requires policy**
:::

![](Images/03_1-Public-Policy-Research.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Let's refresh some of the big arguments from our discussions

<br>

**First and foremost, what is "policy"?**

- (**SLIDE**: The Burke quote)

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

![](Images/02-1-Burke_Quote.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

I like the Burke quote just because it puts the focus in the right place

- Government is a human effort to deliver what we want

- Policy is, in essence, rules created by a government or community for managing our needs

<br>

**According to Munger, why is policy a non-optional requirement for all communities?**

- **Why can't we just leave each other alone?**

- (**SLIDE**: The Hun-gats thought experiment)

:::




## {background-image="Images/02-1-cavemen.jpg" .center}

::: notes

Munger described the Hun-gats tribe as a pre-historic human community  that was running out of food

- The tribe lacks information on what new foods are safe to eat and what are not

- Survival odds are maximized by coordinating our experimentation on food!

- Every man for himself leads to rampant death through wasted experimentation

<br>

Bottom line:

1. Policy is not optional in a community if you want to survive

2. There was never a "state of nature"

    - Stop pretending your intuitions about what people would do without government matter for how we should govern ourselves

3. Battles over expertise are unavoidable and a key part of the process!

    - There is no "perfect" policy, all policies create winners and losers

<br>

**SLIDE**: If there is no perfect policy, what do we aim for?

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

### To maximize your chances of success, your policy proposals must be:

::: {.r-fit-text}
- Specific,

- Adapted to the stakeholders,

- Adapted to the science of the problem, 

- Adapted to the rules of the community, and

- Be at least as good as the alternatives.
:::

::: notes

*Read slide*

<br>

I'm not saying you can't create rules that violate these characteristics, but you shouldn't if the goal is to produce durable and positive change in a community!

<br>

**SLIDE**: And that took us to the SUPER important pre-requisites for all public policy

:::




## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Policymaking Pre-Requisites**

<br>

You must convince the community that:

1. We have a public problem, and

2. We require a collective decision to solve it
:::

::: notes

Each pre-requisite is a distinct argument that you have to successfully make before moving to any actual policy-design

<br>

**What does it mean to say we have a public problem? As opposed to what?**

- (**Private Problem**: "My choice has no consequence for your welfare")

- (**Public Problem**: "My choices affect your welfare"

<br>

**What does it mean to say we require a collective decision? As opposed to what?**

- (**Individual Decision**: "I can choose, alone and without interference")

- (**Collective Decision**: "Choices are made by a group, and are binding on all")

<br>

**Any questions on the material from last week?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: This week I want us to perform a comparative case study of local communities dealing with environmental problems

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Environmental Problems in Local Communities**

- Today: Failure Cases

- Thursday: Success Cases

:::

![](Images/02_1-case_studies.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

*NOTE: Moved the "explaining theory" slides to right before that part of the exercise*

<br>

This case study exercise has two broad aims:

<br>

FIRST, I want us to help each other develop a broader list of specific examples of local communities grappling with environmental problems

- As we move into community work, the broader your base of examples the more adaptable you will be to the needs of specific communities

- You don't have to reinvent the wheel for each problem you confront

- Use the examples to help you avoid common roadblocks and select more effective strategies

<br>

SECOND, we use a comparative case study exercise to give you a head start on thinking about policy-making in terms of theory and process

- While our work in this class will tend to focus on hands-on activities...

- Learning to think about these problems as a social scientist, in terms of observation, measurement and theory, will make you a more effective community activist

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, let's introduce the failures!

:::






## The Failure Cases {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
1. What was the specific "environmental" problem?

2. Did the community try anything specific to address it?

3. Why are you convinced this was a failure?
:::

::: notes

Let's speed around the room to introduce the cases

- In a moment we'll dig more deeply into all of them, but let's begin with a broad overview

- Be an active listener as we do this!

<br>

*PRESENT each*

<br>

*Split class into small groups (groups of four)*

- Go sit with your group!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Characteristics of the problem

:::



## Analyzing the Failure Cases {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

**1. Characteristics of the Environmental Problems**

- What are the common characteristics for the environmental problems in our failure stories?

- Make a list of at least FIVE characteristics

::: notes

Groups, take some time to review ALL of the cases submitted on Canvas in order to make this list.

- **Questions on the task?**

- Go!

- *You go around and keep pushing them to make five clear ideas*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Characteristics of the Community

**2. Characteristics of the Community**

- What are the common characteristics for the communities in our failure stories?

- Make a list of at least FIVE characteristics

::: notes

Groups, take some time to review ALL of the cases submitted on Canvas in order to make this list.

<br>

**3. Characteristics of the Policy**

- What are the common characteristics for the policies in our failure stories?

- Make a list of at least FIVE characteristics

::: notes

Groups, take some time to review ALL of the cases submitted on Canvas in order to make this list.

- This assumes the submitted case described a failed policy

- If no policy was attempted then feel free to skip that one for this list

- **Questions on the task?**

- Go!

- *You go around and keep pushing them to make five clear ideas*

<br>

Ok, groups, you have reflected on all of the cases today and used them to generate lists of characteristics common to these failures

- Our job now shifts from classifying cases to theorizing explanations

<br>

**SLIDE**: What do I mean by "theorizing explanations"?

:::



## Theory as a Scientific Tool {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

### Why do some communities successfully solve serious environmental problems while others do not?

::: notes

Let's say this is the research question we are exploring this week with our case studies.

<br>

**Give me one of the characteristics you just brainstormed for environmental policy failure**

- (**SLIDE**)

:::






## Theory as a Scientific Tool {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width = 10, fig.height=2}
## Manual DAG
d1 <- tibble(
  x = c(-3, 3),
  y = c(1, 1),
  labels = c("Predictor", "Policy\nOutcomes")
)

ggplot(data = d1, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size = 0, color = "white") +
  theme_void() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-4, 4)) +
  geom_label(aes(label = labels), size = 7) +
  annotate("segment", x = -1.9, xend = 1.85, y = 1, yend = 1, arrow = arrow())
```

::: notes

Ok, put that characteristic in this diagram in place of the word "predictor"

- e.g. that is the variable we are suggesting causes variation in policy outcomes

- The arrow represents the direction of causality

- Here variations in the predictor cause variations in the outcome

- You may refer to this in other classes as an independent and dependent variable

<br>

**Now, tell me the story of WHY you believe THIS specific predictor causes variation in policy outcomes**

- **Why does this arrow exist AND why does it point in this direction?**

- (*DISCUSS*)

<br>

Your explanation why (e.g. the story behind this arrow) IS your theory

- Theories, in science, are the stories we have designed to help us explain the world

- They are simplifications of complex processes meant to help us understand why things happen the way that they do

<br>

Somebody give us an example from their major!

- **What is a theory you have studied and what does it help us explain?**

- *REPEAT*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Why do scientists spend time generating and testing theories?

:::


## Theory as a Scientific Tool {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

![](Images/02_1-topo-map-1.webp){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

I particularly like the analogy of theories as maps

- This topographic map is super useful for planning a hike

- Close together lines mean steep elevation changes, far apart means more gradual

- We can use this to plan a gentle stroll or a strenuous challenge!

<br>

Thanks to this map we don't have to start from scratch in navigating the world

- The map provides guidance to navigating a complex set of processes

- As community problem-solvers the more we understand the maps, the more effective we can be in our community

<br>

**Any big picture questions on theory as scientific explanations?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Back to our cases

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Theories of Environmental Problem-Solving**
:::

<br>

### We are LESS likely to solve an environmental problem when...

- The problem looks like X

- The community looks like Y

- The action taken looks like Z

::: notes

Ok, groups, take your lists of characteristics and use them to generate theories of environmental problem-solving

- Basically, I want you to describe for me the characteristics you believe make addressing an environmental problem harder AND give us the reason WHY

- Aim for at least one theory per category!

- **Make sense?**

- Go!

<br>

*ON BOARD: Problems vs Community vs Policies*

- Ok, groups, let's go round robin and add theories to the board under each heading

- Let's get at least one theory in each category from each group

- *PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

Now, in research design terms, our work today has been focused on theory generation, NOT testing

- **For those who have taken research design before, why can't we call our work today scientific testing of these new theories?**

- **Haven't we confirmed them with our empirical data?**

- (**SLIDE**: Two substantial problems with that idea)

:::




## Problem 1 {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

**An example of circular reasoning and overfitting** 

![](Images/03_1-Overfitting.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}


::: notes

Imagine you dropped ten marbles on the ground from a height of 2 feet

- Then you drew a line connecting all of the marbles

- How confident are you that redoing the experiment would end with ten new marbles all hitting the ground and staying on the line you just drew?

- That's the danger of overfitting your data

<br>

Useful theory explains MORE than just the cases we have in hand

- Confirmation of our theories using the same data that generated them tells us nothing about the theory

- The goal is general answers to important questions, not limited answers specific to a small subset of cases

<br>

In a very real sense, the theories we have brainstormed today are overfit to the cases we have because we designed them to fit these specific cases as perfectly as possible

<br>

Only if our theories prove predictive on NEW cases should we feel confident about what we've created!

<br>

**SLIDE**: The second problem

:::



## Problem 2 {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png"}

<br>

**Selecting on the Dependent Variable**

![](Images/02_2-Selecting_Dependent_Variable1.png){.absolute left=0 width="500"}

![](Images/02_2-Selecting_Dependent_Variable2.png){.absolute right=0 width="400"}

::: notes

Problem 2 is that we have been selecting on the dependent variable which is a form of selection bias

<br>

Generally speaking, selection bias happens when the sample of data you are analyzing is biased in some way

- And by "biased" we mean it doesn't represent the variety of cases we need it to

<br>

One specific form of selection bias is selecting on the dependent variable

- I'm guessing the authors of these pieces want you to think all you need to do is tweak your parenting or your breakfast routine and you too will be successful!

- But without checking to see if unsuccessful people also eat chia seeds, you can't really know anything about how the world actually works

<br>

Our work today focused on failures only so we can't know if the mechanisms we brainstormed are predictors of failure or simply correlated with these specific cases

<br>

**Make sense**?

<br>

So, that means we need variation on the key outcome of policy success!

- **SLIDE**: Assignment for next class

:::



## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

Find an example of a **LOCAL** community **SUCCESSFULLY** addressing an environmental problem

- Report on the policy and evaluate it using the concepts from the Munger chapter

::: notes

For next class we shift to the successs stories!

- We need more data in order to see if the obstacles we identified today are real issues or just selection bias

<br>

**Questions on the assignment or any of the material from today?**

<br>

Canvas DISCUSSION: Cases Illustrating Local Communities Solving Environmental Problems (10pts)

Find us an example of a LOCAL community anywhere in the world solving an environmental problem (focus on small communities, cities or counties).  

- No overlap in cases! (e.g. don't submit a case someone has already submitted)
- Make sure to provide evidence to support your claims (APA citations)

1. Describe the environmental problem they confronted, 
2. Describe the community facing the problem (Who are they? Where are they located? What do they look like demographically?), 
3. What specifically did they do to address the problem?
4. Why do they believe it worked?
5. Apply the Munger material to your case: How is this an example of a community choosing to frame this problem as "public" rather than "private"?
6. Apply the Munger material to your case: How is this an example of a community choosing to frame this problem as requiring a "collective" rather than an "individual" decision to address it?
