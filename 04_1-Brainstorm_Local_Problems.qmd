Prep for Class

1. Review and record participation submissions

<br>

This week we have a VERY important task to complete

- We need to agree on a local environmental problem to focus on this semester!

<br>

**SLIDE**: But first, quick refresher on policy and Springfield from last week!

::: notes

We began last week by working to unpack and evaluate the arguments from Michael Munger's book *Analyzing Policy*.

<br>

I think the second chapter of this book does a really effective job helping us:

1. Define what we mean by "policy",

2. Think critically about the pre-requisites of making policy in any community, and

3. Introducing us to ways of answering the question, "is this a good or wise policy?"

<br>

**According to Munger, what is policy and why do we need it?**

**Survival makes policy a necessity**
:::

::: notes

Policy is, essentially, a public rule of behavior

- e.g. don't commit murder, don't steal other people's stuff, don't run next to a pool!

<br>

And most importantly, survival makes policy a necessity

- The Hun-Gats don't appear to have any option for avoiding starvation without it

<br>

**SLIDE**: Dictionary definition...

:::



## What is Policy? {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

"A definite course or method of action selected (as by a government, institution, group or individual) from among alternatives and in the light of given conditions to guide and usually determine present and future decisions..." (Webster's Third International Dictionary).

::: notes

Again, the dictionary is NOT a be-all and end-all source for defining concepts

- However, in this case it does usefully highlight elements I believe are useful for community problem-solvers

<br>

To maximize your chances of success, your policy proposals should be:

- Specific,

- Adapted to the stakeholders,

- Adapted to the science of the problem,

- Adapted to the rules of the community, and

- Be at least as good as the alternatives.

<br>

**And, according to Munger, what are the pre-requisites for making policy?**

- **In other words, what work do you have to do before you start designing a policy to solve a real-world problem?**

- (**SLIDE**)

**Policymaking Pre-Requisites**

<br>

You must convince the community that:

1. We have a public problem, and

2. We require a collective decision to solve it
:::

::: notes

In other words, how do we decide how to decide?

<br>

**Why is this such an important step?**

<br>

- Policymaking is hard enough without having to fight the community while you do it

- There is no "perfect" or "cost free" policy so you'd be crazy not to engage with the community to find out their needs and concerns

- Rule enforcement is hard and costly so generate buy-in on the process from the community BEFORE starting policy design

<br>

In short, this is the work you MUST complete if you have any hope of making a policy in a community that the members will follow without strict and costly enforcement

<br>

**Finally, what tool and approach did Munger suggest for helping us think about whether or not a specific policy is the "right" one for a problem and a community?**

**Munger's (2000) Three "Wisdoms"**

1. Markets

2. Politics

3. Experts
:::

![](Images/02-1-Munger_Fig2-1.png){.absolute right=0 bottom=0 width="600"}

::: notes

Munger notes that many policy debates in society reflect tensions between these three perspectives or "wisdoms"

- Each represents a different way of evaluating what a "good" policy looks like.

<br>

**What does it mean to hold "markets" as your preferred wisdom?**

- A preference for allocating resources AND solving problems using systems of private exchange. 

- Concerned primarily with process, less so with outcomes

- Preference for non-interventionist style policies wherever possible

- Rules only to keep that market well functioning (contract enforcement, etc)

<br>

**What does it mean to hold "politics" as your preferred wisdom?**

- A preference for allocating resources AND solving problems emphasizing the role of institutions and citizen involvement in the process. 

- Institutions designed to coordinate and facilitate collective action 

- Typically concerned about process and outcomes 

<br>

**What does it mean to hold "experts" as your preferred wisdom?**

- Preference for allocating resources AND solving problems emphasizing deeper knowledge of the systems involved. 

- "someone who has the goal of improving the functioning of politics or markets" (31).

- Those systems can be economic, political or scientific.

<br>

**Does one of these wisdoms come closest to your perspective on policy?**

<br>

**Importantly, how does considering the three wisdoms help us as policymakers?**

- Identifying the root causes of societal conflicts over specific problems

- Brainstorming policy approaches / identifying compromise positions

- etc

I have two big aims for this class:

1. I want to teach you some of the basic tools you will need to engage productively in solving problems in our community, and

2. I want us to take these skills, and your energy, into the community in order to accomplish something meaningful

<br>

This week we need to decide on what local environmental problem we are going to focus our work on!

- **SLIDE**: The assignment for today

:::



## What are our options? {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

### Let's build a list of current, local environmental problems

- Who is being impacted? By how much?
- Primary causes?
- Does anyone benefit from the problem or causes?
- What is meaningful progress?

::: notes

Alright, let's give all our proposed options a quick hearing

- I have the general prompts from Canvas on the slide

- I'll try to track the big picture options on the board as we go

<br>

At this point I am asking you to listen to each and consider your level of interest in that problem

- Think of it like trying on hats.

- Put each one on and think about what it would mean to try and tackle this problem this semester

<br>

To help us reflect on each problem I will ask you to NOT try and sell us on your problem

- I don't want today to focus on the arguments, just the details

- **Does that make sense?**

<br>

**Any questions?**

- Go!

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

Pick **ONE** local environmental problem and make **three arguments**:

1. This is an important public problem (with evidence)

2. It requires a collective decision (with evidence)

3. We should pick this as our focus for the semester because...
