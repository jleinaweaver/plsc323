Prep for Class

1. Record Canvas submissions

<br>

*Announce grade rebalancing*

- You're doing excellent work and I want to keep your focus on our community and getting into the world to take action

- So, I'm proposing we rebalance the course grade 

- Original plan: 50%-50% split participation vs papers

- Proposed: 60-40% split with a greater emphasis on your participation and activities in the community

- The better job we do pushing ourselves into the community, the more I will skew the grade to reward you for that work

- **Any questions or concerns about the change?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Coming back from spring break so let's do a quick refresher

**Engaging Productively as Problem-Solvers**

1) **Describe** the problem facing our community

2) **Investigate** the relevant stakeholders

3) **Frame** the problem for the stakeholders

4) **Design** a policy to address the problem

5) Take **action** to push the plan forward!

::::

::: notes

Here is the problem-solving process we developed over the first half of the semester.

- As a refresher, let's talk about the finer details underpinning this approach

<br>

*Actual Plan you followed today (winging it) that I think went really well*

- *You gave them a hypothetical and asked them to advise that person*

- Let's say someone in our community comes to you for help solving a local environmental problem

- They tell you they are concerned that increases in traffic are causing damage to the roads and tire breakdown is poisoning our water supply so we need higher fuel taxes

- **How would you help them?**

- (*Don't confuse problem definition with preferred strategy!* etc.)


<br>

*Original Plan*

**If you were advising a group in this process, how would you explain the first step to them?**

- **What needs to be described and what do we mean by community?**

<br>

I would encourage that group to begin with a description of BOTH the natural science and the social science involved in the problem

- The natural science is key to understanding the mechanisms and reactions of the environment to our actions

- The social science is key to understanding how the interests in that community make decisions and bind each other to those decisions

- I feel strongly that you cannot understand a real-world problem without learning both elements

- **Make sense?**

<br>

**If you were advising a group in this process, how would you explain why so much of it is focused on the stakeholders?**

- **Aren't they the bad guys in our environmental problem story?**

<br>

FIRST, I would emphasize that there is no single, correct definition of the environment (or any environmental problem) so ease off on the "bad guy" talk.

<br>

SECOND, the stakeholders are the entire ballgame in solving your problem

- Even if it's unsatisfying in a "purity" sense, I would always rather have rules embraced by a community rather than imposed against their strong objections

- I want the stakeholders making different decisions and owning those new decisions!

<br>

**Any questions on our process?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Our work over the weeks building up to spring break was focused on deepening our understanding of the problem

::: notes

We didn't get to touch base after our last field trip, so let's do it now!

<br>

**What were your big takeaways?**

- **New stakeholders identified?**

- **Aspects of the problem we hadn't considered?**

- **Existing institutions or infrastructure to be aware of?**

- **Curent projects we could help with?**

- **Current needs identified?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, the break is done and it's time to push our project forward!

### **Aim: Develop a useful problem-framing for food waste in our community**

:::: {.incremental}

- Problem Framing Report due Apr 11th (end Wk 12)

- No in-person class Week 12 (Apr 8 and 10)

- [https://ozarksfoodharvest.org/how-to-help/volunteer/]()

- Sarah Byrd (sbyrd@ozarksfoodharvest.org), Andrew Magnus (amagnus@ozarksfoodharvest.org) or Dillon Smith (dsmith@ozarksfoodharvest.org) 

::::

::: notes

Over the next four weeks we will focus our energies on steps 2 and 3 in our process

- Our aim is to develop a USEFUL problem-framing for food waste in our community

- By useful I mean the framing is adapted to the science, the economics and the needs of the relevant stakeholders

- THIS will be the version of the argument we can take into the community with a hope of moving stakeholders to our position

<br>

**REVEAL**: Your next written paper will be the Problem Framing Report that presents your revised argument

- In essence, this is a revised version of your first report designed for a specific, targeted audience

- It's no longer about you or your preferred view of the world, it's now about the stakeholders and what they want

- Due Apr 11 which is the end of week 12

- Don't worry, we will build to this deliberately in class using literature, exercises and group analyses

<br>

**REVEAL**: As part of this plan I am going to cancel our class meetings in Week 12 (Apr 8 and 10) so you can do two things: 

1) Focus on writing the report, and 

2) Making a difference in our community!

<br>

**REVEAL x 2**: I will require each of you to volunteer for one shift (2 hours minimum) with Ozark's Food Harvest

- Please use this [website to sign-up](https://ozarksfoodharvest.org/how-to-help/volunteer/)

- Trouble signing up reach out to: Sarah Byrd (sbyrd@ozarksfoodharvest.org), Andrew Magnus (amagnus@ozarksfoodharvest.org) or Dillon Smith (dsmith@ozarksfoodharvest.org)

- You may complete this volunteer exercise anytime between now and Apr 11th, BUT it must be completed by then. 

<br>

**Any questions on this plan?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's start building to this outcome report

## Common Pool Resources (CPR) {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png"  .center}

::: {.fragment}
...refers to a natural or man-made resource system that is sufficiently large as to make it costly (but not impossible) to exclude potential beneficiaries from obtaining benefits from its use. 

...it is essential to distinguish between the *resource system* and the flow of *resource units* produced by the system, while still recognizing the **dependence** of one on the other" (Ostrom 1990, 30).
:::
::: notes

**Reach back in your memory to Elinor Ostrom's Nobel Prize winning work and tell me, what is a common pool resource (CPR)?**

- (**REVEAL**)

- Relatively large resource systems that produce value for their users

- Often usefully thought of as a flow resource

    - In a sense, managing a CPR is like taking water from a hose
    
    - You can turn the hose on or off to control when you are taking benefits from it, and
    
    - You can turn the hose up or down to control the rate of resource extraction

<br>

**And why did Dr. Ostrom want us to think about solving environmental problems in terms of CPRs?**

<br>

FIRST, it makes us more productive problem-solvers

- A healthy system is more than just a source of resource units

- The health of the units is a more complex question than just asking about the system they live in

<br>

SECOND, it helps us ask more useful questions

- Bad Question: How do we save the North Atlantic cod fishery?

- Good Question: Under what conditions can we produce the "maximum quantity" of units "without harming the stock or the resource system itself"?

<br>

**SLIDE**: We used the CPR concept to help us brainstorm definitions of food waste as a flow problem

**Defining Food Waste as a CPR**

<br>

**1. The "flow" of food creating insecurity**
:::

| **Resource System** | **Resource Units**         | **Notes**                              |
|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| The Community       | Food (lbs)                 | Businesses vs Families vs Charities    |
| The Community       | Grocery store placement    | Neighborhood food deserts      |
| The Community       | Farm output (lbs)          | Food for humans, animals or industry |

::: notes

First we explored how food insecurity could be thought of as a "flow" problem.

- Communities must make choices about how to distribute food, grocery stores, and the production choices on farms

| **Resource System** | **Resource Units**         | **Notes**                              |

| Households          | Food waste (lbs)           | Productive use vs thrown away          |
| Grocery stores      | Food waste (lbs)           | Productive use vs thrown away          |
| Restaurants         | Food waste (lbs)           | Productive use vs thrown away          |


::: notes

Second we conceptualized food waste as a flow of waste problem

- This reads as the most direct version of the food waste problem

- Whereas we conceived of food insecurity as a community decision, this seems to locate the key flow as being controlled by more specific groups

| Community Health    | Food (lbs)                    | Used vs Donated vs Wasted |

| Atmosphere          | Food waste (lbs) |  Emissions from waste  |

::: notes

The question for us is, which versions of the food waste problem do we want to focus on for the rest of the semester?

- Don't answer this question out loud yet!

<br>

First, everybody take a few minutes to reflect on these options

- For yourself, narrow down the list to **THREE** versions of the problem you would be most interested in tackling

<br>

*Lead class discussion, help them narrow down to three or four options*

- Let's try to pick options that push us in different directions on the problem!

- *ON BOARD*

<br>

*Split class into three (or four) groups and assign one of the CPR problem definitions to each*

- GROUPS, sit together, away from the other groups

<br>

GROUPS: Take a few minutes to discuss this baseline CPR version of the problem. 

- Get ready to report back to us your evaluation of this version of the problem

1. In what specific ways does this problem definition help us address the problem? 

2. In what specific ways does this problem definition make addressing the problem harder?

<br>

*REPORT BACK and DISCUSS*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Stakeholder report time

## Building a List of Stakeholders {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

:::: {.fragment}

::: {.r-fit-text}

1. Who are they?

2. Connections to the flow of food waste?

3. Evidence of previous engagement?

:::

::::

::: notes

For today I asked you to help us begin to build a list of relevant stakeholders in our community.

- I asked you to do some preliminary research focused on your chosen stakeholder

- My assumption is that each of you have a stakeholder, have contact info for them and evidence of their presence in our community

<br>

**REVEAL**: In a moment we will go around the room to introduce each of your chosen stakeholders using three prompts

1. Who are they?

2. How are they relevant to our community's food waste problem?

3. How have they engaged in the local community in the past?

<br>

GROUPS, this is an active listening exercise!

- You need to build a list of the stakeholders you hear today that may be relevant to your specific version of the problem

- Don't assume you know the answer before hearing each report! 

- Listen to why each one was submitted and be open to including them on your list

<br>

**Questions?**

- Go!

## Building a Stakeholder Map {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

### What are the types of stakeholder relevant to your specific problem definition?

::: {.fragment}

- Whose actions influence the flow of the units?

- Whose buy-in to a plan would make policy change easier?

:::

::: notes

Groups, I want you to take a few minutes to reflect on your problem definition and evolving stakeholder list. 

- Your job is to create a stakeholder map of your problem 

- By that I mean, a representation of the kinds of stakeholders relevant to your problem definition

<br>

**REVEAL**: *Read slide*

<br>

**Any questions on the exercise?**

- We're doing this AFTER hearing the stakeholder assignment results because I'm hoping that pushed you to think more broadly about your problem

- A more complete map is a more useful map of your problem

<br>

BEFORE you get to work, one important note!

- Once you have your broad "types" identified, your next job is to think about the variation within them

- **SLIDE**: Imagine one type for you is "restaurant"

:::

![](Images/09_1-food_trucks.webp){.absolute right=325 bottom=0 width="40%"}

::: notes

If I was targeting "restaurants" I would want to think about how best to increase my coverage of that concept in our community

- e.g. examples of different sizes, ownership structures, locations, etc

<br>

Your goal is to ensure this data collection process gives you a REPRESENTATIVE sample of the population

- OTHERWISE, you wil be incredibly limited as to the inferences you can draw and the policy designs you can consider

- In other words, if I wanted to be able to make inferences about "restaurants" in our community then my sample of restaurants better be broad and diverse!

<br>

This DOES NOT mean any future policy must be adapted to all of them

- This work ensures you have the best chance of finding actual solutions that can be applied in the real world

- Maybe we discover that food truck waste is "low hanging fruit"?!?

<br>

**Does this make sense?**

## The Stakeholder Map (Due Apr 1) {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
Fill in your map of relevant stakeholders

- **YOU** must submit **TWO** new stakeholders to Canvas

- Coordinate within your group!

- One new prompt: Interview!

:::

::: notes

The aim is for each group to have a ton of stakeholder information relevant to their problem definition

- No overlap! Make sure you each find and submit new cases!

- Make sure you have example stakeholders for ALL the types in your map!

- Due before class April 1st

<br>

The new prompt:

- Reach out to your selected stakeholder for information relevant to your problem definition. 

- Be respectful of their time, but don't be afraid to introduce yourself and your work on this problem to see if they have thoughts about food waste they would be willing to share. 

- BEFORE you do this you must share with me your proposed questions so I can keep an eye on the process and help steer you in positive directions.
