Prep for Class

1. Review Canvas submissions

2. Make sure the theories generated last class are here!

3. Save theories generated today in your notes

<br>

Welcome back all!

- **SLIDE**: This week we're doing comparative case study analysis

**Environmental Problems in Local Communities**

- Last Class: Failure Cases

- Today: Success Cases

![](Images/02_1-case_studies.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

REMEMBER, this case study exercise has two broad aims:

<br>

1. We need more examples of real communities facing real problems!

    - Don't reinvent the wheel, learn from other peoples' successes and failures

2. Effective community activists use theory as a jump start on problem solving! 

- Learning to think about these problems as a social scientist, in terms of observation, measurement and theory, will make you a more effective community activist

<br>

**SLIDE**: So, what did we learn from the failures last class?

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Theories of Environmental Problem-Solving**
:::

<br>

### We are LESS likely to solve an environmental problem when...

- The problem looks like X

- The community looks like Y

- The action taken looks like Z

::: notes

Hit me!

- **What theories did we propose for explaining these failures?**

- *Make sure each theory is attached to a complete-ish explanation of WHY you believe this mechanism explains failure*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's jump into our new cases

:::




## The Success Cases {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
1. What was the specific "environmental" problem?

2. What was the specific action taken and by whom?

3. Why are you convinced this was a success?
:::

::: notes

Let's speed around the room to introduce the cases

- In a moment we'll dig more deeply into all of them, but let's begin with a broad overview

- Be an active listener as we do this!

<br>

*PRESENT each*

<br>

*Split class into NEW small groups (four groups to maximize board space)*

- You have to work with new people!

- Go sit with your group!

<br>

Ok, groups, you now understand the goals of our exercise a bit better (e.g. generating theory)

- So, let's attack this a bit differently than last class

<br>

**SLIDE**: Just like last class we'll split our case study analysis into THREE parts

:::



## Analyzing the Success Cases {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width = 10, fig.height=1.6}
## Manual DAG
d1 <- tibble(
  x = c(-3, 3),
  y = c(1, 1),
  labels = c("Environmental\nProblem\nCharacteristics", "Policy\nSuccess")
)

ggplot(data = d1, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size = 0, color = "white") +
  theme_void() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-4, 4)) +
  geom_label(aes(label = labels), size = 7) +
  annotate("segment", x = -1.9, xend = 1.85, y = 1, yend = 1, arrow = arrow())
```

::: {.incremental}
1. Brainstorm FIVE characteristics common to the environmental problems

2. Pick ONE characteristic and diagram on the board

3. Write your theory below the diagram (bullet points)

:::
::: notes

**REVEAL**: FIRST, I want you to focus entirely on the characteristics of the specific environmental problems in our success cases

- We'll do community and policy characteristics next

- **Everybody clear that I want theories focused ONLY on problem type to begin?**

- Just like last class your first job is to brainstorm a list of FIVE characteristics common to the problems in our success cases

- I'd like the groups to design different theories so the options help us avoid overlap!

<br>

**REVEAL**: Next you add your DAG to the board

<br>

**REVEAL** THEN, you explain your theory below it!

- Bullet points in complete sentences please

<br>

**Questions on the assignment?**

- Let's go!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

- *You record the theories in your notes!*

<br>

Let's mix up the groups and do it again!

1. Brainstorm FIVE characteristics common to the communities involved

2. Pick ONE characteristic and diagram on the board

3. Write your theory below the diagram (bullet points)

::: notes

New groups, focus on the characteristics of the communities in our success cases

- Brainstorm five characteristics, pick your favorite and brainstorm a theory for us!

- Go!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

- *You record the theories in your notes!*

<br>

Let's mix up the groups and do it one last time!

## Thinking Theoretically {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

### What are our big picture takeaways from the comparative case studies this week?

- What makes solving a local environmental problem easier?

- What makes it harder?

::: notes

**Which theories we've brainstormed this week do you feel best about? e.g. theories likely to be useful beyond these specific cases?**

- **Why?**

<br>

**Which theories do we feel least confident in based on our cases? e.g. most likely overfit to our sample?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: For next week
:::



## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

**Textbook processes of community problem-solving**

- Clarke and Peterson (2016)

- Hughes (2007)

- Kraft (2011)

- Submit reflections to Canvas

::: notes

Next week we continue to refine our thinking about what it takes to successfully navigate community problem-solving

- Tuesday we will review a series of proposed processes for success

- Thursday we will invite reps from nonprofits into class to share with us their perspectives of working in Springfield and SW MO

<br>

**Questions on the assignment?**

<br>

Canvas ASSIGNMENT: Designing a plan of attack for solving problems in our community (4pts)

What are THREE key elements you argue are necessary to successfully navigate a domestic policy-making process? 

- Make sure to fully explain each point using complete sentences
