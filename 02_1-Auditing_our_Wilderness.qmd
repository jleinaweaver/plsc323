::: notes

In our first class last week we simulated a resource management problem.

<br>

**What was the problem your community faced in our game?**

- (How to manage a renewable resource)
- (How to distribute benefits in a community)

<br>

**What rules did you create? Why?**

- **e.g. number of fishers, selection of fishers, enforcement of the rules?**

<br>

**Was this management effort a success? Why or why not?**

<br>

Clarify the terms of "success" here for me.

- **What were you trying to maximize? What was a "good" result?**

<br>

- **Were you maximizing the sustainability of the resource, the gains of the collective or the gains of one individual?**

<br>

I really like this opening simulation for a bunch of reasons:

- It gives me a sense of who each of you are as individuals

- It gives me a sense of who you are as a collective

- It asks each of you to think about a community problem like a political scientist

- And, frankly, it's a lot of fun

<br>

**SLIDE**: But there are also some lessons on problem-solving we should keep in mind

:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Politics in everything!**

- EVERY problem exists in a community

- EVERY community is a complex mix of:

    - Actors
    - Rules
    - Interactions
:::

::: notes

*Read slide*

<br>

Each proposal for managing the resource was evaluated by the class in terms of the rules and processes they already operate within

- This means that new rules and processes must be adapted to the rules and processes already in place

<br>

Each proposal was altered based on the other proposals!

- We all have to live together and even the "best" rules will fail if the community does not recognize them as legitimate

<br>

You guys were rather eager to jump to murder as a means for enforcing the rules

- This means that trust is a vital component of creating rules that will work

- Societies with a lack of trust are in for a rough time trying to solve problems.

<br>

**Is everybody clear on the importance of thinking about the "politics" when problem-solving?**

- As policy-makers you need to keep these lessons in mind

<p style="color: white;">What is the "Trouble with Wilderness"?</p>

:::

::: notes

On Thursday we then dug into one of my favorite articles exploring our relationship to the environment.

- Cronon, W. (1996). The Trouble with Wilderness or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature. *Environmental History*. 1(1), 7–28.

<br>

**So, what is the "trouble with wilderness" according to Cronon?**

- (**SLIDE**: The argument we explored in class)

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

**The Trouble with Wilderness (Cronon 1996)**

<br>

+ Pre-19th century humans define the wilderness as sublime

+ As American society "develops" we needed a domesticated wilderness that could indulge our myths

+ A romanticized wilderness creates an impossible standard of management

Therefore, wilderness is a human creation and our mythologizing about it makes it harder to solve environmental problems.

::: notes

**What did you think of Cronon's approach to making this argument using a lens on society primarily framed by history, art and literature?**

- **Strengths and weaknesses of this approach?**

<br>

For those of you coming out of PLSC 223 you know the American relationship to wilderness is more complicated than this

- It's not that Cronon is wrong, he's not, but he is focusing primarily on the divide between the Edenic and a preservation view of wilderness

- There are a number of other competing environmental ethics in our society but I think Cronon does an excellent job zooming in on one of the primary divides we grapple with in problem-solving today

<br>

**And what is the lesson of this article for us if we want to solve real-world environmental problems?**

**Setting the Stage for Problem-Solving**

1) All environmental concepts are contested

2) Your chosen definition narrows your options

3) Many disputes arise from conflicting definitions
::::

::: notes

To refresh where we ended last week...

1. We must remember that all of the concepts related to environmental problems will be contested (e.g. fought over),

    - No matter how obvious you think the problem is, I assure you that all of the stakeholders view it somewhat differently
    
<br>

2. Your chosen definition automatically narrows the options of policies you think are acceptable vs not

    - Definitions set the agenda of future action

    - Be strategic when establishing a definition and be flexible in considering alternative viewpoints

<br>

3. Conflicts over problem definitions often drive the most serious disputed regarding environmental problem.

    - The most effective policy solutions begin with clear definitions that generate buy-in from the relevant stakeholders

<br>

**Questions on any of this?**

<br>

Our work for this week is to explore and adopt a policy-focused lens for analyzing problems in our community

- Think, less historical narrative a la Cronon or our PLSC 223 class

- More like our simulation game last week with individuals, constrained by rules, making decisions and enforcing standards

<br>

**SLIDE**: Your assignment for today

## {background-image="Images/02_1-Drury_Campus.jpg" .center}

::: notes

For class today I asked each of you to spend an hour exploring the Drury campus and surrounding streets thinking critically about the “wilderness” in our backyard. 

- I'm hoping you embraced the spirit of Cronon's work and adopted VERY broad definitions of the "environment".

    - e.g. the usual (plants, animals, air, soil) and other aspects of our well-being (transportation, food, safety, etc.)
    
<br>

First I want you to talk to me about the experience of doing the exercise

- **What was it like to spend an hour wandering our campus? Did you get bored? Did you get distracted? Did you let yourself relax?**

<br>

**Did you zoom in on the people at all? e.g. How they used the campus and interacted with each other?**

- **Any patterns stand out?**

<br>

As I said to you last week, environmental problem-solving is rooted in complex and inter-dependent communities

- The better you get at seeing the world in different ways, the more effective you will be as a problem-solver

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's report back on the first prompt

:::


## Canvas Question 1 {background-image="Images/02_1-Drury_Campus_v2.png" .center}

<br>

### What are examples of Drury’s “wilderness” that we are managing well?

::: notes

*Canvas Q1: Share examples of successful management*

- *PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

**All in all, how much WILDNESS is there on campus?**

- **Not wilderness, WILDNESS**

<br>

**What are the characteristics of "successful management" in these examples?**

- **e.g. What is being prioritized and for whom?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Next prompt

:::



## Canvas Question 2 {background-image="Images/02_1-Drury_Campus_v2.png" .center}

<br>

### What specific actions do you take AS PART OF YOUR TYPICAL ROUTINE that contributes to the protection and promotion of wilderness on Drury’s campus?

::: notes

*Canvas Q2: Share examples of positive individual actions*

- *PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

**From our submitted examples, what individual choices have the biggest bang for the proverbial buck?**

- **In other words, what actions on this campus do you think have the biggest possible positive impact on our environment?**

<br>

**Generally speaking, but building from our examples, do we suspect that the biggest impact actions always carry the biggest costs to us as individuals to do them?**

- **In other words, IFF we decide that changing individual behavior is key, are we going to be asking people to make impossible sacrifices for abstract "environmental" gains? Why or why not?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Next prompt

:::


## Canvas Question 3 {background-image="Images/02_1-Drury_Campus_v2.png" .center}

<br>

### What specific aspects of Drury’s “wilderness” need to be improved or managed better?

::: notes

*Canvas Q3: Share examples of Drury's environmental needs*

- *PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

Imagine we could address each of these needs

- **What specific benefits would we observe on campus from addressing each one?**

- **How substantial would these impacts be?**

<br>

<br>

**SLIDE**: Final prompt

:::



## Canvas Question 4 {background-image="Images/02_1-Drury_Campus_v2.png" .center}

<br>

### What specific actions do you take as part of your typical routine that contribute to these problems?

::: notes

*Canvas Q4: Share examples of problematic actions*

- *PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

**What can we infer about the people that make these choices?**

- **Are these choices reflective of our character?**

- **In other words, does doing these things make us "bad" people? Why or why not?**

<br>
