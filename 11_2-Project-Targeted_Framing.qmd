**OUTCOME 2**

**The Problem Framing Report (Due Apr 11)**
:::

<br>

### The purpose of this paper is to reframe the "call to action" argument you made in the last report for the stakeholders you identified as relevant in your map of our community.

::: notes

**Questions on the assignment?**

<br>

Remember, this should be a report you could distribute to the stakeholders in our community and THEY would find it convincing!

<br>

*NOTES from last class*

- Make a convincing argument that our community has an important, public environmental problem that should be addressed collectively.

- BUT frame the argument to generate buy-in for collective action from specific groups.

- The test of your argument being "convincing" is how well it explicitly accounts for the preferences of the specific stakeholders you are working with

<br>

Today I want you to have a chance to work with your groups on the process of analyzing the stakeholders in your map

- **SLIDE**: Prompt 1 - "Importance"

<br>

### Prompt 1

- **Argument: Our community faces an "important" environmental problem**

- Where is the overlap in the interests of your stakeholders in terms of the importance of this problem?

::: notes

Groups, discuss the first prompt in terms of the data you have gathered, the map you have built and the specific problem you are working on

- Get some ideas on the board so we can see what you are developing

- Go!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Prompt 2

<br>

### Prompt 2

- **Argument: Our community faces a "public" environmental problem**

- Where is the overlap in the interests of your stakeholders in terms of the public nature of this problem?

::: notes

Remember, public here means "My choices affect your welfare"

- NOT "My choice has no consequence for your welfare"

<br>

Groups, discuss this prompt in terms of the data you have gathered, the map you have built and the specific problem you are working on

- Get some ideas on the board so we can see what you are developing

- Go!

**Analyzing your Stakeholder Map**
:::

<br>

### Prompt 3

- **Argument: Our community should make a collective decision to address this environmental problem**

- Where is the overlap in the interests of your stakeholders in terms of the need for collective action on this problem?

::: notes

Remember, "collective" here means "choices are made by a group, and are binding on all"

- NOT “I can choose, alone and without interference”

<br>

Groups, discuss this prompt in terms of the data you have gathered, the map you have built and the specific problem you are working on

- Get some ideas on the board so we can see what you are developing
