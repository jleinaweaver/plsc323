**Engaging Productively as Problem-Solvers**

1) **Describe** the problem facing our community

2) **Investigate** the relevant stakeholders

3) **Frame** the problem for the stakeholders

4) **Design** a policy to address the problem

5) Take **action** to push the plan forward!

::::

::: notes

Here is the problem-solving process we've been following this semester

- You are currently working to flesh out a stakeholder map of your version of the problem (e.g. Step 2)

- That fleshed out map is due next class!

<br>

In class over the last two weeks we've been building up the tools you need to do Step 3.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's refresh our memories on these tools and concepts

**Stakeholders vary in terms of their risk profiles**

::: notes
**What does it mean to say that stakeholders vary in terms of their risk profiles?**

<br>

**When trying to solve a problem would you rather deal with stakeholders who are risk averse or risk acceptant?**

<br>

It depends, right?

- If the benefits of your solution are uncertain, you need a risk acceptant stakeholder to sign up!

- If the costs of inaction are distant, you might need risk averse stakeholders 

<br>

**Give me a real-world example**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Temporal discounting 
:::


## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Stakeholders vary in their relationship to time**
:::

![](Images/13_1-bad-ancestor.webp){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes
**What does it mean to say that stakeholders vary in terms of their relationship to time?**

- **e.g. temporal discounting and time horizons**

<br>

**When trying to solve environmental problems would you prefer your stakeholders have long or short time horizons? Why?**

- (Sustainabilty as a concept is only a meaningful problem over the long-term)

<br>

**When trying to solve environmental problems would you prefer your stakeholders have high or low discount rates? Why?**

- (Low, right?)

- High discount rates lower the value of future benefits (e.g. clean air for our grandkids become valueless)

- High discount rates lower the impact of future costs (e.g. sea level rise in 100 years is sooo far away!)

<br>

**SLIDE:** Uncertainty

**Why would uncertainty over ecological processes impact our efforts at problem-solving?**

<br>

**Why would uncertainty over the economic impacts of the harms impact our efforts at problem-solving?**

<br>

**Why would uncertainty over the costs of limiting the damages impact our efforts at problem-solving?**

<br>

**Why might uncertainties about tipping points (nonlinear costs and benefits) and irreversibilities complicate our problem-solving?**

![](Images/10_2-bonus_points.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

But first!

- You have done excellent work this semester, so I would like to give all of you some bonus points

<br>

Being a very benevolent dictator, I want to let you decide how many bonus points you would like

- In short, and to keep this easy to track, I will give you two choices and you pick ONE of them

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center} 

::: {.r-fit-text}
Option 1

- Give 1/2 a bonus point to the entire class
:::

::: notes

This option allows you to give every person in class, including yourself, 1/2 a bonus point

- If everyone in a class of 20 chooses this, everyone gets +10 on their final paper

- Please note, I only keep whole numbers and I round down in this game

<br>

**Any questions on option 1?**

:::


## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center} 

::: {.r-fit-text}
Option 1

- Give 1/2 a bonus point to the entire class

Option 2: 

- Receive ALL of the 1/2 points from option 1, AND 

- Add 5 extra points for yourself
:::

::: notes

If you choose option 2 you get two things!

1. You get all of the points contributed by those who chose option 1
    
2. IN ADDITION, you personally will receive an EXTRA five bonus points

<br>

Let's game this out one time

- Imagine a class of 20 splits in half

- The ten people who choose option 1 generate 5 bonus points for everyone in class

- The ten people who chose option 2 get those 5 points PLUS 5 extra for a total of ten

<br>

A couple notes of clarification here:

1. Let me be very clear, if you choose option 2 you get everything the people in option 1 get plus an extra bonus.

    - You lose nothing from this choice

2. Your choice MUST be made secretly

    - No one is allowed to see your choice
    
    - If you break this rule you get nothing.
    
3. Your choice will remain secret

    - Only you and I will ever know the choice you made
    
    - It is entirely up to you after the game to reveal your choice if you want to

<br>

*Send link to Google Form or point them to Canvas link*

- The link to make your choice is now on Canvas in the Modules

- No talking from this point on!

- Go!

<br>

**Before I reveal the results, any guesses as to the outcome?**

- **What are you basing your guesses on?**

## Collective Action Problems {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center} 

<br>

"A collective action problem or social dilemma is a situation in which all individuals would be better off cooperating but fail to do so because of conflicting interests between individuals that discourage joint action" (Wikipedia 2021).

::: notes
Let's start with the first sentence from the Wikipedia entry!

<br>

**How did our bonus point game illustrate a collective action problem?**

<br>

Often we introduce collective action problems using a Prisoner's Dilemma. 

- **Has anybody ever heard of the Prisoner's Dilemma?**

- (**SLIDE**)

## {background-image="Images/07-1-bank_robbery.jpg"} 

::: notes
You can tell the story many different ways, but here's a quick version.

<br>

Two thieves rob a bank and decide to split up in order to make their getaway

- The plan is meet up later and divvy up the loot.

<br>

The cops catch each of them separately and bring them "downtown" for questioning.

<br>

Both still had their guns with them when captured so are in some trouble / look pretty darn suspicious.

- e.g. gun possession is good for a couple years in jail
:::



## {background-image="Images/07-1-interrogation.png"} 

::: notes

Now we introduce the dilemma facing our robbers

- The robbers are placed in separate interrogation rooms.

- Each is made an offer at the same time.

<br>

**The Offer**: The first one to confess to the robbery and agree to testify against the other person goes COMPLETELY free.

<br>

Put yourself in the shoes of one of the robbers.

- As a first pass, we can think of this as a simple decision for you.

- **SLIDE**
:::



## Your Decision {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

<br>

+ Confess quickly and go free

OR

+ Stay silent and go to jail
:::

knitr::include_graphics('Images/07-1-cartoon_thief.webp')
```
:::
::::

::: notes

*Read options on screen*

<br>

In a world where only you matter, the decision is pretty easy to think through as a cost-benefit analysis.

- Going free is pretty universally preferred to going to jail.

<br>

However, the outcome of this dilemma depends on both the choice YOU make AND the choice made by the other suspect.
:::



## {background-image="Images/12-1-Eric-Garland-Game-Theory.jpg" background-size='95%'} 

::: notes

That means, it's time for some game theory!

- Game Theory is a theoretical approach to analyzing decision-making born from micro-economics.

<br>

Game theory primarily focuses on individuals (or groups who make decisions collectively)

- It is typically applied to competitive situations wherein outcomes are determined by the actions of all the players

- And ultimately it is meant to help us evaluate strategies for navigating these scenarios.

<br>

#### Old notes
- Game theory is "the branch of mathematics concerned with the analysis of strategies for dealing with competitive situations where the outcome of a participant's choice of action depends critically on the actions of other participants" (Oxford Languages).

::: notes

In game theoretic terms this is what we call a non-cooperative game in normal form.

- The four boxes represent the four possible outcomes of the game

- We get to a single box once we know the decision of each player.

<br>

*Go through a couple to make sure it's clear*

<br>

**So, in this position what would you do and why?**

- *Force discussion of each option*

<br>

- (Is the other suspect your best friend or just some guy?)

- (How much evidence do the cops already have?)

- (Do you already have a record?)

<br>

**So, what do we think is the most likely outcome for these two prisoners?**

- (Everybody's going to jail!)

::: notes

Game theory is designed to help us analyze social dilemmas like this.

<br>

Game Theory Principle 1: We expect the players in this game to pick their dominant strategy (if one exists)

- We define a "dominant strategy" as one that wins for you REGARDLESS of what the other player does.

<br>

Game Theory Principle 2: We expect the players to reach an outcome that is Pareto optimal.

- Pareto optimality means no one can improve their final position without making the other person worse off.

<br>

A good place to start when analyzing these games is to find the Nash Equilibrium

- Approach named for the mathematician John Nash.

<br>

To find the NE imagine what you would do if you had perfect information.

- e.g. You know what the other robber is going to do before he does it!

Given the choice, I suspect most people choose 6 over 10 years of jail time.

**So, what does this mean for you in playing the game?**

- **What do we learn from imagining we had perfect information?**

<br>

This shows us that there IS a dominant strategy in this game.

- Regardless of what the other player chooses you reach your preferred outcome by confessing.

<br>

The dominant strategy in game theory refers to a situation where one player has a superior tactic regardless of how the other players act. 

- In this game, no matter what the other person does, your better outcome comes from confessing.

<br>

**Does this make sense?**

"a stable state of a system involving the interaction of different participants, in which no participant can gain by a unilateral change of strategy if the strategies of the others remain unchanged" (Oxford Languages).
:::

::: notes
The logic is mirrored for both subjects

- With perfect information the second robber should always prefer confessing to staying silent

<br>

It turns out that confess, confess is the Nash Equilibrium

- For both players, confessing is the dominant strategy and that leads to a single outcome

<br>

**REVEAL** definition

<br>

In this version of the game, no player can make themselves better off by changing their own decision if the other player's decision is fixed

- If you know they are going to stay silent, you should confess and changing that will NOT make you better off

- **Make sense?**

## Collective Action Problems {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

"A collective action problem or social dilemma is a situation in which all individuals would be better off cooperating but fail to do so because of conflicting interests between individuals that discourage joint action" (Wikipedia 2021).

::: notes
Back to our definition of a collective action problem!

<br>

The PD is one version of a class of games we refer to as collective action problems

- **Does everybody now have a better sense of what this definition is talking about?**

<br>

In short, collective action problems arise when individuals want to cooperate but can't seem to get there because of the complexities of the world.

- Our readings for today illustrate two ways the world conspires to make cooperation harder.

For today I had you read a short excerpt from Garret Hardin’s "Tragedy of the Commons."

### Anybody ever read this before?

First and foremost let me tell you, I AGONIZED over whether or not to assign any piece of this reading to you.

- On the plus side this is one of, if not THE, most cited and assigned research articles studying policy and the environment.

- Nearly 50,000 citations.

I assigned you only the portion relevant to our work, that which describes the pasture thought experiment.

- The rest of the article is motivated reasoning of the worst kind, so let's ignore it!

The Commons: "...the natural resources and vital life-support services that belong to all humankind rather than to any one country" (Chasek, Downie and Brown 2014).

- Think oceans, seabed minerals, Antarctica and the atmosphere.

- None exist within the borders of any sovereign state.

<br>

Think of this like an Ostrom-style Common Pool Resource that has no owner or exists outside the sovereignty of any individual state to control

- **Any questions on the baseline concept?**

## {background-image="Images/07-1-empty_pasture.jpg" .center}

::: notes
**What did you submit to Canvas as your analysis of the biggest environmental obstacle identified by the Hardin piece?**

<br>

The tragedy of the commons is typically explained using a story about a pasture.

### Who owns this pasture?

- (No one?)
- (Everyone?)
- (Both?)

<br>

### Does it make sense that if no one owns the pasture, everyone owns it?

### - Does that equivalency make sense?
:::



## {background-image="Images/07-1-pasture.jpg" .center}

::: notes
For the sake of this discussion, all of you are ranchers who own herds of cattle.

- On this commons you all choose to graze your cattle.

<br>

**Why would you choose to graze your cattle on the commons pasture and not your own land?**

- (maximize benefits by not having to pay to feed them!)

<br>

So, let's go back to the problematic equivalency from a moment ago.

- **Who actually pays to feed your cattle when they feed on the commons?**

- (Everyone pays PLUS the environment pays and the public pays)

+ Costs = -1
:::
::::

::: notes
To keep things simple, let's say each of you currently face the following decision.

<br>

The hypothetical costs and benefits of adding a cow to your herd is almost perfectly off-setting. 

- Add a cow to gain 1 but you also have to pay 1.

<br>

**In this instance, should you add a cow to your herd?**

- (Probably not in this case)

- (Maybe if as your scale increases the costs of adding each additional cow falls?)

<br>

Now, what happens to the CBA when we add a cow to the commons?

- **How does using the commons to feed your new cow alter your CBA?**

**To the Commons**

+ Benefits = +1

+ Costs = -1/x
:::
::::

::: notes
**First, why doesn't using the commons change the benefits?**

- (Still your cow!)

<br>

The key difference is in the costs

- X is the population size

- This says that the costs of feeding your cow is shared amongst everyone

- The commons loses 1, but that cost is divided amongst the owners of the commons e.g. everybody.

<br>

**Does that make sense?**

<br>

Important distinction here: Society pays MOST of the costs of feeding your cattle.

- That means we each pay part of the cost.

<br>

**So, if you are the only person using the commons, should you add a cow?**

- (Takes us back to the previous +1 + -1 = 0.)

<br>

**What happens to the costs you face as the population around you gets bigger?**

- (Your share of the cost shrinks to almost nothing)

- The more of us there are, the smaller your individual share.

<br>

### So, what is the bottom line here? When should you add a cow to your herd?

- (1. When there is a commons to feed it, and)

- (2. When there are a lot of other people also using it.)

<br>

### And what does all of this mean for the survival of the commons?

### **Hardin argues that the commons is doomed because...**

::: {.r-fit-text}

1. The benefits are real and immediate

2. The costs are small and shared

3. Doing the "right" thing doesn't matter

:::
::: notes

*Read criteria*

- Point 3: Doing the "right" thing simply opens up the chance for profit for someone else!

<br>

In essence, Hardin is arguing the Commons is a PD game and your dominant strategy is to defect every round!

- This is essentially a justification for environmental exploitation

- You may as well do it before someone else destroys the environment

<br>

**Can everybody now see why Ostrom, and many others, reacted so poorly to this argument?**

- Hard to accept humanity is compelled to commit suicide

- Not much empirical evidence of this actually happening over and over again.

- As we noted in the PD game, other factors matter too for whether we decide to defect or not!

<br>

Clearly, the Hardin argument is limited, however, there is something important we should take from it.

::: {.r-fit-text}
Individual Benefits + Collective Costs = Resource Depletion
:::

::: notes

This represents the first kind of collective action problem that makes environmental problem solving complicated.

- IF benefits of an action accrue to the individual

- BUT the costs of that action are shared by society

- THEN we tend to see resource depletion

<br>

**Does this make sense?**

<br>

Back to your groups!

- GROUPS, take a few minutes to reflect on your problem definition and current stakeholders map

- **Do you see evidence of this kind of collective action problem at play? Why or why not?**

<br>

**Per your Canvas submissions today, what are the policy options proposed by Harding for addressing these kinds of problems?**

- (Privatize the commons, OR regulate access to the commons by government)

So, here's the game you played against each other person in the class.

<br>

**Does this game have a dominant strategy? why or why not?**

- **If you had perfect information, what would you do?**

- ("Take"!)

<br>

**So, does this mean everyone in class should have "taken" rather than "contributed"? Why or why not?**

- (Built on a huge assumption: This dominant strategy assumes only one other player!)

<br>
    
**How does this table change if you updated it to reflect playing with 19 other people?**

```

::: notes

The dominant strategy for a single person thinking only of themselves is to "take."

- If the class contributes then you "take" 14 points instead of 10

- If the class takes then you "take" 5 instead of zero

<br>

But what about the class acting together?

- **Is their dominant strategy to "take"?**

<br>

No! It's to contribute!

- If the individual contributes then you "contribute" to get 10 points instead of 5

- If the individual takes then you "contribute" to get 9 instead of five!

<br>

**So, what is the lesson from this?**

- Individuals who feel disconnected from the community more likely to defect!

- Big gains from acting together

<br>

The key for us as policy designers, and what Olson wants to help you understand, is that we CAN overcome free-riding with good policy design!

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
Individual Costs + Collective Benefits = Free Riding
:::

::: notes

Mancur Olson identifies that flipping the costs and benefits ALSO leads to a serious problem: Free-riders.

- In Hardin's story, individuals make good choices for themselves which combine to make bad choices for society.

- In Olson's story, he shows us that it is REALLY hard to get individuals to pay tiny costs in exchange for big benefits for the wider society.

- In a system where you benefit from collective action whether you help or not, your individual incentives will push you to not help

<br>

**Does that make sense?**

<br>

Back to your groups!

- GROUPS, take a few minutes to reflect on your problem definition and current stakeholders map

- **Do you see evidence of this kind of collective action problem at play? Why or why not?**

<br>

*Report back and DISCUSS*

<br>

**Per your Canvas submissions today, what are the policy options proposed by Olson for addressing these kinds of problems?**

- (Smaller groups advantaged for stopping free-riding)

    - Easier to monitor, more social pressure to comply
    
- (Large groups need institutional designs to increase compliance)

    - Membership benefits for paying dues (access to a park, magazine, bumper stickers)
