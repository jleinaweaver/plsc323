Section 2 of our class has focused on identifying the environmental needs in our community

<br>

**REVEAL**

Specifically, we've spent the last three weeks exploring and engaging with groups working on concrete problems in our community

- We reviewed the Springfield Community Focus Reports to get a sense of community priorities, stakeholders, successes and areas of need

- We met with representatives from local nonprofits (CPO and CFO) to get a sense of how organizations in our community approach problem-solving

- At the Fairbanks location of the Springfield Community Gardens we learned about their mission and got our hands dirty with composting, weeding, and building new planting structures

- At the Springfield Conservation Nature Center we tackled, literally at times, invasive species (bush honeysuckle) in order to promote better spring growth and the health of the center

- At the Watershed we...

**In what ways did our work illustrate the role of "politics" in community problem-solving?**

- **How was politics involved in the work being done at each of those sites?**

**Did our efforts in the field at each site improve the wilderness in Springfield or shrink it?**

**What elements of the problem-solving processes we discussed in Week 4 are illustrated by the work at the community gardens?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Nature Center

<br>

*NOTES*

DOC'S KEY: 

- Definition (problem and outcome; avoid letting strategies be presented as the problem; problems are neutral and don't typically need 'must' or 'should'), 
- Objectives (set clear targets), 
- Constraints (be aware of boundaries, limitations, assumptions, unacceptable impacts), 
- Strategies (Brainstorm and be creative), 
- Keepers (Choose the best strategy), 
- Experiment (Test a strategy and adapt), 
- Yes! (Implement)

The Collaborative Approach (Clarke & Peterson 2016)

- Is an adaptive process
- Uses the most appropriate science and technology
- Is implementable
- Incurs low transaction costs
- Has appropriate funding
- Is measurable
- Is socially legitimate

Problem-solving is not someone else's responsibility

- It is not the purview of some faraway government, and it's not someone else's fault if things aren't getting better.

<br>

It is for us to do right here in our backyards.

- It takes so little to make a substantial difference and you can have an impact right away if you're willing to put a little sweat into it

Our work this week is meant to segue us into the third section of the class

- Today we share all of the environmental problems you submitted to Canvas as a chance to hear a bunch of options and think big picture about what solving them would take

- For Thursday you will select one of them and it will be your focus for the rest of the semester

- You don't have to pick the one you submitted to Canvas!

<br>

Then in Section 3 we will:

1. Continue to find opportunities to volunteer in the community,

2. Learn concepts and tools for analyzing environmental problems in ways that makes solving them easier, and

3. Give you chances to deepen your analysis of the problem you select this week

<br>

**SLIDE**: Today we hear all the options!

1. What is the specific problem you submitted?

2. Identify three causes of this specific problem

3. Who currently benefits from this problem?

4. What would MEANINGFUL progress look like?

::: notes

I'm going to ask each of you to claim some space on the board, and describe your canvas submission for the class

- I'll give you the prompts and we'll discuss as we go

- Save space to work down the list of prompts

<br>

**REVEAL**: What is the specific problem you submitted? (Canvas Q2)

- *PRESENT EACH*

<br>

**DISCUSS: Are all of these problems per the "D" in Hughes (2007)?**

- e.g. not strategies masquerading as problems, neutral statements, no "must" or "should"

<br>

**REVEAL**: Identify three causes of this specific problem (e.g. why is this important?)

<br>

**DISCUSS: How and why did you zoom in on these three?**

- **Was it hard to pick only three? Or hard to stretch it to three?**

<br>

**REVEAL**: Who benefits?

<br>

**DISCUSS: Will these benefits be a serious obstacle to solving the problem? Why or why not?**

<br>

**REVEAL**: What would SPECIFIC and MEANINGFUL progress on this problem look like?

<br>

**DISCUSS: Which problems would have the greatest positive impact on the community if we could solve them?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: For next class

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

Pick **ONE** local environmental problem and submit to Canvas:

1. Define the problem

2. Argue: This is an IMPORTANT problem

3. Argue: This is a PUBLIC problem

4. Argue: This problem requires a COLLECTIVE decision

::: notes

**Questions on the assignment?**

<br>

Canvas ASSIGNMENT: Drafting an Argument for Action (15pts)

Pick ONE local environmental problem and submit the following:

1. A thesis statement: Define your selected local, environmental problem as clearly as you can. Keep Hughes' (2007) advice in mind and don't define the problem using your preferred strategy. 

2. Make an argument that this is an IMPORTANT problem (4-5 sentences)

3. Make an argument that this is a PUBLIC problem (per Munger (2000), 4-5 sentences)

4. Make an argument that this problem requires a COLLECTIVE decision (per Munger (2000), 4-5 sentences)

NOTES: These three arguments are certainly related to each other, but your job is to keep them distinct. Your over-arching argument needs to convince the reader that your problem is important, that specific individual choices impact community welfare, and that we require a community decision to address it.
