**The Most Important Environmental Problems**

- Local?

- National?

- Global?
:::

::: notes

*Split class into three parts based on where they are sitting*

<br>

Groups, introduce yourselves to each other and start making three lists on the board

- What are currently the most important environmental problems we face at the global, national and local levels?

- By the way, "climate change" is not a specific enough answer for these lists
    - Climate change is a magnifier of other problems, list the specific problems

<br>

*Share lists and discuss*

- How are you defining "important"?

- "Who" matters most according to your list?

<br>

**SLIDE**: Introductions

:::



## Introductions {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Designing Solutions for Environmental Problems**

**Required Courses**

- BIOL 163 Science of the Environment

- ECON 225 Introduction to Environmental Economics

- PHIL 320 Environmental Ethics

- **PLSC 323 Issues in Environmental Policy**

::: notes

That brings us to the capstone experience, e.g. this class!

- In here we bring the politics and policy to the table.

<br>

In other words, given the science, the economics and the ethics of a given environmental problem, what can we feasibly do to address it?
:::




## {background-image="Images/01_1-politics1.png"}

::: notes

Given our large number of non-majors we should take a moment to define a key concept in our class: Politics

**Non-majors, when you think of the word "politics" what do you think of?**

- **Is it compromise, good faith and teamwork?**

<br>

**When we describe someone as "political" what are we saying about them?**

- **Is it a flattering description?**

<br>

The word politics these days is often attached to awful behavior by self-serving morons.

- That is decidedly not what we study in political science

- Or, that is not the only thing we study in political science

<br>

Rather than start with a technical definition, let's simulate a political problem related to the environment and see if that clears things up

:::

knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_1-cartoon_lake.jpg")
```

::: notes

As a team-building exercise you have all decided to go on a one week camping trip together.

- While on a hike on the first day you come across a small lake stocked with fish

<br>

### Anybody like to go fishing?

### - Are you good at it?

- *Use volunteer, give a d12 and see if they can roll a 1-11 (92% chance of success)*

<br>

So, X goes fishing and successfully catches one fish

- As you eat the fish you get the distinct sense that you just earned extra credit in this class

- Congratulations! You've discovered a small lake of magical bonus point fish!

- Each fish you catch and consume adds 3 EC points on first paper grade

- Catch 3 fish in our simulation, boost your first paper by almost a full letter grade

<br>

**Everybody with me so far?**

- **SLIDE**: Let's talk complications

:::



## Managing a Resource is Hard {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

![](Images/01_1-cartoon_lake.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: {.incremental}

1. Your chance of catching a fish depends on the remaining stock and the number of fishers each day

2. The health of the fishery depends on your collective use

:::

::: notes

**REVEAL**: Your chance of catching a fish depends on two things:

1. How many fish have you taken out of the lake so far

    - As the stock of fish gets smaller, it is harder to catch what's left

2. How many of you go fishing that day

    - As the number of fishers goes up, the harder it is to catch a fish

<br>

**REVEAL**: The fishery is a finite, but sustainable, resource

- If you remove fish beyond the maximum sustainable yield (MSY), the size of the fishery will decline over time

- If you remove too many fish, the fishery itself could collapse (insufficient stock to reproduce fast enough to survive)

<br>

**Any questions on the broad-strokes of the scenario?**

<br>

Your camping trip lasts one week and you will have the opportunity to fish every day (7 days)

- *Keep using the three groups from the board lists exercise*

- I'm going to ask each group to make a proposal to the class for how they would like us to manage this resource

- Groups, get ready to pitch us your plan

- **SLIDE**: Plan needs to specify...

:::



## Propose a Management Policy {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

1. How many fishers per day?

2. How should the fishers be chosen? 

3. How will you ensure compliance with these rules?

![](Images/01_1-cartoon_lake.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

**Any questions on the exercise?**

- Groups, get to brainstorming and get ready to pitch us on your plan.

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

- *Class chooses a plan*

<br>

*Run the simulation*

- *ON BOARD: 7 columns (one for each day) with space below for names*

- *Each day all fishers put name on board, roll for success and then circle the successes and strike out the fails*

- *P(Catch) depends on # of fishers PLUS remaining stock*
    
    - *Each fisher beyond 1 takes us down the d12 table (1 fisher needs <=11, 2 needs <=10, 3 needs <=9, etc)*
    
    - *Each 10 fish removed takes our starting point 1 down the d12 table*
    
- *You track total removed and at end let them know what happens to the fishery: Starting stock 100 fish, a MSY of 65 and a tipping point at 30*

**d12 probabilities**

cbind("Roll"=11:1, "Probs"=round(11:1/12, 2))

**What explains the outcome of our game?**
:::

::: notes

Everybody take a moment to reflect on our game.

- Get ready to explain, from your perspective, what just happened?

<br>

**Bottom line, why did we end up with the outcome of the game that we did?**

- **Biggest reason(s) in your mind?**

<br>

1. **Did everyone in class have the same goals?**

2. **Did making rules as a community help? Why or why not?**

3. **Did you worry much about compliance with the rules? Why or why not?**

4. **Did you care about the survival of the fishery? Why or why not?**

<br>

Games and simulations are often a useful tool for exploring politics.

- What we just played was a fairly basic resource distribution game.

- It highlights a ton of important stuff, but let me know draw out a few important ideas

<br>

**SLIDE**: Standard definitions of politics...
:::



## {background-image="Images/01_1-politics1_v1.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**1. Decision-making in a community**
:::

::: notes

One way that we study "politics" is by focusing on **how groups make decisions**.

- Group decision-making is complex and multi-layered

- It is also one of the **fundamental building blocks** of our society 

<br>

I set a fairly simple rule in your game, a majority vote.

- But that is FAR from the only way we could have done it! 
:::




## {background-image="Images/01_1-politics1_v1.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**2. How we make and enforce "the rules"**
:::

::: notes

A second way that we study "politics" is by focusing on **the rules**.

- Once a society has established rules, many political scientists study how those rules are interpreted, revised and enforced

- **The decision to punish a rule-breaker is a huge decision** that often sends ripples out through a community

<br>

**Out of curiosity, what would happen if today SGF police started pulling over EVERY car that exceeded the speed limit by even 1 mph?**

- **Seriously, walk me through how our community changes and reacts to that change in policy.**

<br>

**And what would happen if they completely stopped enforcing speed limits?**

- **Again, walk me through how our community changes and reacts to that change in policy.**

:::


## {background-image="Images/01_1-politics1_v1.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**3. Who gets what, when and how?**
:::

::: notes

A third way that we study "politics" is by focusing on **the distribution of costs and benefits**.

<br>

Why do groups form? 

- Often it is **to produce greater resources** than any individual could do on their own

    - This could be money, food, a division of labor, or collective security

- HOWEVER, producing that good means **someone has to pay** and someone has to benefit

<br>

Who pays and who benefits is **a constant tension** in any society.

<br>

Bottom line, anytime a group of people have to come together to make a decision, a political scientist can be found who is interested in the process.

- **Any questions on this broad definition of the concept "politics"?**

**Solving Environmental Problems in a Political World**

::: notes

And that brings us to our primary aim in this class: 

- Our big goal this semester is to find a local environmental problem, learn a ton about it and then try to make a difference in it

- I mean this. My ambition is that we get out into the world and get something done.

- Will we succeed? Who knows! But let's give it a shot!

::: notes

Everyone should download and read the syllabus.

- Tons of important course policies in there and by taking this class you are agreeing to all of them

<br>

Since this capstone class has ambitions of getting out into the world and making a difference, I need you all to come to class and be engaged

- We're only going to get as far as you're willing to push.

- The attendance and participation policies are meant to help motivate you!

<br>

Half your course grade this semester is about showing up, being prepared and engaging in the work of our class.

- You'll see on the Modules page of Canvas that most of our class sessions have a reading plus an assignment

- To get credit you must submit these assignments BEFORE class begins.

<br>

There is an attendance cliff in this class

- Anyone with more than three unexcused absences in the semester cannot earn higher than a ‘C’ in the course (regardless of grades earned on other assignments).

- IFF you have an excused absence coming up **YOU** are required to contact me by email for excused absences
    
    - Coach emails alone DO NOT COUNT

<br>

The other half of your grade will consist of reports presenting your analyses and action plans for our selected environmental problem

- More to come on that soon.

<br>

**Any questions on these grades or policies?**
