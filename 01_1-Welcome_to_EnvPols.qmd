**(PLSC 323)**

<br>

### What are the most important environmental problems facing us today at the **global**, **national** and **local** levels?

<br>

::: notes
Prep for Class

1. Prep simulation probability code in R OR bring D12 dice for the class to roll

2. Need a way to record fishing results: sheet of paper or spreadsheet

<br>

*Encourage this conversation as people come in, get ideas up on the board IN THREE LISTS!*

<br>

Introduce yourselves to each other and start making lists!

- "Climate change" isn't specific enough for this list. Do you mean rising sea levels? Spread of disease? More intense storms?

<br>

*Share lists and discuss*

- How are you defining "important"?

- "Who" matters most according to your list?

That brings us to the capstone experience, e.g. this class!

- In here we bring the politics and policy to the table.

<br>

In other words, given the science, the economics and the ethics of a given environmental problem, what can we feasibly do to address it?
:::




## {background-image="Images/01_1-politics1.png"}

::: notes

Given our large number of non-majors we should take a moment to define a key concept in our class: Politics

### Non-majors, when you think of the word "politics" what do you think of?

### - Is it compromise, good faith and teamwork?

<br>

### When we describe someone as "political" what are we saying about them?

### - Is it a flattering description?

<br>

The word politics these days is often attached to awful behavior by self-serving morons.

- That is decidedly not what we study in political science

- Or, that is not the only thing we study in political science

<br>

Rather than start with a technical definition, let's simulate a political problem related to the environment and see if that clears things up

:::

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '87%'}

```

::: notes

As a team-building exercise you have all decided to go on a two week camping trip together.

- While on a hike on the first day you come across a small lake stocked with fish

<br>

### Anybody like to go fishing?

### - Are you good at it?

- *Use volunteer, give a d12 and see if they can roll a 1-11 (92% chance of success)*

<br>

So, X goes fishing and successfully catches one fish

- As the fish dies you get the distinct sense that your course grade has just gone up by one bonus point!

- Congratulations! You've discovered a small lake of magical bonus point fish!

<br>

Here's the deal: Each fish in this lake is worth one bonus point and now you, as a group, have to decide how to successfully manage this resource while taking advantage of it.

- Your camping trip lasts two weeks and you will have the opportunity to fish everyday (14 days)

- You can design any management rules you would like and enact them with a simple majority vote.

<br>

**SLIDE**: There's always a catch! (pun intended)

::: notes

Catch #1: Your chance of catching a fish depends on how many people go fishing each day of the camping trip.
- The more of you who fish in a day, the harder it is to catch a fish

<br>

We'll use d12 dice to simulate probabilities for us.

- The table tells you what the probability of catching a fish is depending on how many of you go fishing

- If two of you go fishing on day 1, then each of them rolls the d12 ONE TIME and must get any number between 1 and 10 to succeed. Easy!

- If nine of you go fishing on day 1, then each has to roll a 1, 2 or 3 to succeed! Much harder.

<br>

### Does that make sense?

::: notes

Catch #2: The health of the fishery depends on your responsible use of the resource

- The more of you who fish each day, the greater chance the fishery collapses (overfishing ends the resource)

<br>

After all of the day's fishing is done, one of you will roll a d12 to see if your overfishing has destroyed the fishery

- e.g. did the magical fish population collapse?

<br>

As you see in the table, the risks are low, BUT remember that even low risks compound over time!

- Avoiding even a '1' in 12 chance gets harder and harder over time (see notes at bottom)

<br>

### Any questions on the game?

<br>

Talk as a group and then let me know who is going fishing on day 1

- *Run the simulated result for each fisher and the resource as a whole*

- *Move to next day and repeat*

<br>

**Notes**

**d12 probabilities**
```{r}
rbind(1:12, round(1:12/12, 2))
```

**Risks of 1/12 over time**
```{r}
# Risks of 1/12 over time
rbind(1:14, round((1-1/12)^c(1:14), 2))
```

**What explains the outcome of our game?**
:::

::: notes

Everybody take a moment to reflect on our game.

- Get ready to explain, from your perspective, what just happened?

<br>

*Report back and discuss*

<br>

### Did everyone in class have the same goals?

<br>

### Did making rules as a community help? Why or why not?

<br>

### How did the risks of failure impact your behavior? Did it matter to you or not?

<br>

### Bottom line, why did we end up with the outcome of the game that we did? Biggest reason in your mind?

<br>

Games and simulations are often a useful tool for exploring politics.

- What we just played was a fairly basic resource distribution game.

- It highlights a ton of important stuff, but let me know draw out a few important ideas

<br>

**SLIDE**: Standard definitions of politics...
:::



## {background-image="Images/01_1-politics1_v1.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**1. Decision-making in a community**
:::

::: notes

One way that we study "politics" is by focusing on **how groups make decisions**.

- Group decision-making is complex and multi-layered

- It is also one of the **fundamental building blocks** of our society 

<br>

I set a fairly simple rule in your game, a majority vote.

- But that is FAR from the only way we could have done it! 
:::




## {background-image="Images/01_1-politics1_v1.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**2. How we make and enforce "the rules"**
:::

::: notes

A second way that we study "politics" is by focusing on **the rules**.

- Once a society has established rules, many political scientists study how those rules are interpreted, revised and enforced

- **The decision to punish a rule-breaker is a huge decision** that often sends ripples out through a community

<br>

### Out of curiosity, what would happen if today SGF police started pulling over EVERY car that exceeded the speed limit by even 1 mph?

### - Seriously, walk me through how our community changes and reacts to that change in policy.

<br>

### And what would happen if they completely stopped enforcing speed limits?

### - Again, walk me through how our community changes and reacts to that change in policy.

:::


## {background-image="Images/01_1-politics1_v1.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**3. Who gets what, when and how?**
:::

::: notes

A third way that we study "politics" is by focusing on **the distribution of costs and benefits**.

<br>

Why do groups form? 
- Often it is **to produce greater resources** than any individual could do on their own
    - This could be money, food, a division of labor, or collective security

- HOWEVER, producing that good means **someone has to pay** and someone has to benefit

<br>

Who pays and who benefits is **a constant tension** in any society.

<br>

Bottom line, anytime a group of people have to come together to make a decision, a political scientist can be found who is interested in the process.

### Any questions on this broad definition of the concept "politics"?
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

**Solving Environmental Problems in a Political World**
:::

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_1-environmental-issues.png")
```

::: notes

And that brings us to our task in this class: Our task this semester is to learn how we can tackle environmental problems in a world of politics.

- And remember, by "politics" all I mean is a world where solving these problems requires groups to work together

- This may involve making and enforcing new rules, but it doesn't have to!

<br>

**All policy decisions create winners and losers. ALL OF THEM.**

- The most obvious examples are often tax related
    - e.g. your taxes go up so the government can build a new school

- But the environmental arena is typically much more complicated
    - e.g. reducing the amount of fine particulate matter in the air can save tens of thousands of lives BUT may force a local factory to either layoff workers or produce fewer goods for higher prices
    
<br>

Your job is to find the balance of those costs and benefits so that:
1. Society can successfully address a serious environmental problem,

2. WITHOUT inspiring such push-back or suffering that people either ignore the rules or change them to undo your work!

<br>

We opened class today brainstorming important environmental problems.

<br>

*If enough time split into small groups to discuss and report back, otherwise just discuss as a class*

### Q1: What is the most important local problem on the list? Why?

### Q2: What is the most important national problem on the list? Why? Discuss

### Q3: What is the most important global problem on the list? Why? Discuss

### Q4: What is the most important single problem overall? Why?

<br>

Well, clearly we have a lot to do!

- **SLIDE**: So, let's talk about our aims for the semester (e.g. the learning outcomes on the syllabus) 

:::



## Learning Outcomes {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

**1. Content Knowledge**

- Students should demonstrate the ability to organize the investigation of an environmental problem in terms of its key stakeholders, institutions and uncertainties involved.

::: notes

Translated...

<br>

After this class I want you to be able to organize your investigation of any environmental problem in three parts:

- Who are the key stakeholders and what do they want?

- What are the institutions and how do they structure your options?

- What are the big sources of uncertainty?

:::



## Learning Outcomes {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

**2. Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving Skills**

- Students should demonstrate policy-based problem-solving skills by designing plans that balance the interests of stakeholders against the constraints of established institutions and uncertainty.

::: notes

Translated...

The second LO is really about making sure you are always thinking about problem-solving in terms of balancing winners and losers.

- No environmental problem can be successfully addressed over the long term without making this piece central to the plan.
:::



## Learning Outcomes {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

**3. Communication Skills**

- Students should demonstrate the ability to communicate their policy proposals in clear, concise ways that are tailored to the relevant audiences.

::: notes

Translated...

It doesn't matter how brilliant your plan is, if you can't sell it to the stakeholders it isn't going anywhere.

### Any questions on the LOs?
:::



## The Semester: Three Sections {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

1. The Basics of Problem-Solving in a Community

2. Evaluating Policy Design Options

3. Designing Environmental Policies

::: notes

I have broken our semester into three parts.

- Each part is designed to introduce you to the skills and tools you will need to engage with environmental problems in a political world.


<br>

**SLIDE**: While these three sections represent the conceptual tools in our semester, this is a capstone class and that means our big work is on each of you developing and executing your own project!

```

::: notes

Each of you will select a local environmental problem and then attack it in five assignments.

- Assignment 1 is a paper where you introduce us to the specific, local environmental problem you have chosen

- Assignment 2 is a paper in which you evaluate the pros and cons of four design options for addressing the problem

- Assignment 3 is a poster you will design for Fusion Day this semester in order to collect community feedback on your work

- Assignment 4 requires you to get out and get your hands dirty in our community! 
    - Each of you will find an opportunity to get actively involved in your issue locally (e.g. litter pickup, river cleanup, working with a local NGO or city agency on your issue, etc.) and report back on what you learned.

- Finally, in assignment 5 you will propose a policy to address your chosen problem that takes on board everything you did in the first four assignments.

<br>

### Does the structure of the class make sense?
:::




## {background-image="Images/01_1-coyote.jpg"}

::: notes

This is a capstone class with a very ambitious set of goals, so I need you to be in class every session!

<br>

To encourage that outcome I have designed an attendance cliff.

- If you have more than three **unexcused** absences during the semester you will not be able to earn greater than a C in the class.

- This is regardless of assignment grades.

<br>

### Questions on this?
:::



## {background-image="Images/01_1-office_space.jpg" background-size='75%'}

::: notes

What if you have an excused absence coming up?

- It is your responsibility to email me **BEFORE** the absence in order to receive a make-up assignment.

- Easy peasy

<br>

This is also the place where I say to you, whatever is going on that might keep you out of class, please keep me in the loop. 

- I genuinely want you to make progress on our learning outcomes

<br>

So, if things are getting rough for you please come talk to me.

<br>

**I will always offer you flexibility in the face of struggle IF YOU COME TO ME BEFORE DEADLINES HAVE PASSED!**

### Fair enough?

:::



## {background-image="Images/01_1-participation-points.jpg" background-size='92%'}

::: notes

Ok, so I've got you coming to class now how do I make sure you're doing the work?
- Participation points!

<br>

Basically, if you:
- Get to class on time,
- Have the materials you need to work, and
- Submit all daily required assignments BEFORE class,

You'll be good to go and these are easy free points.

<br>

Before many of our classes we will have a reading and/or an assignment to complete.
- You must submit any daily assignment to our Canvas discussion board BEFORE class begins to earn your participation point.

The two most common ways people lose these points?
- Come to class late, or 
- Come to class without having completed the daily assignment.

<br>

### Questions on this?
:::



## {background-image="Images/01_1-matrix_meme.jpg" background-size='92%'}

::: notes

Your first job is to download the syllabus from Canvas and read it carefully.

<br>

It includes detail on everything you need to know.
- Assignment deadlines
- Readings
- Drury policies

ALSO, I can see who downloaded it, so don’t delay!

<br>

We'll be using Canvas for submitting assignments and sharing readings.

- **All** of our readings this term are available on Canvas.

- Let me know if you have trouble using our class Canvas page
