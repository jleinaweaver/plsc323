Prep for Class

1. Bring d12 dice to class (probability engines!)
    
    - d12 probs to roll this or lower: 11 (92%), 10 (83%), 9 (75%), 8 (67%), 7 (58%), 6 (50%), 5 (42%), 4 (33%), 3 (25%), 2 (17%), 1 (8%)


2. Bring markers to class (3?)

<br>

Welcome to Issues in Environmental Policy

- I'm Dr. Leinaweaver

- **Is everybody in the right place?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Warm up exercise

### **What are the most important environmental problems we currently face?**

:::: {.incremental}
::: {.r-fit-text}
1. Be as specific as possible

2. AT LEAST FIVE problems in a RANKED list

:::
::::

::: notes

*Split class into three parts based on where they are sitting*

<br>

Groups, introduce yourselves to each other and start making a list on the board

- TWO instructions for this exercise

<br>

**REVEAL**: Be specific!

- "Climate change" is an umbrella term for a TON of things

- There isn't enough water to drink in South Sudan is a very specific problem (e.g. tied to a place and a people)

- If our goal is to solve problems then we need to be clear on what the problem is.

- **Make sense?**

<br>

**REVEAL**: Give me a ranked list of AT LEAST FIVE problems

- Ranked means as a list of priorities

- **Make sense?**

- Go!

<br>

*Groups present each list, then Q's for the class*

<br>

**How are you defining "important"?**

- **Is each group defining it the same way?**

<br>

**"Who" matters most according to your list?**

<br>

**Do our high priority lists tend towards problems at the global, national or local levels? Why?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Introductions

1. Name

2. Year in school

3. Major

4. Pathway into this class?
:::

::: notes

This class is almost always a quirky collection of backgrounds and interests!

- Some of you are here for the environment Fusion certificate, and

- Some are poli sci or environmental biology majors

<br>

So, let's go around the room for introductions (and attendance).

<br>

I'll go first.

1. I'm Dr. Justin Leinaweaver.

2. FSU undergrad, masters in IR at UCD and PhD at Trinity.
    - My thirteenth year at Drury

3. I'm a political scientist
    - Research interests: international policymaking, environmental politics and bargaining / negotiations.
  
4. I'm the director of the certificate

<br>

**Your turn**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's discuss the certificate

:::

**Designing Solutions for Environmental Problems**
:::

<br>

**Required Courses**

- PLSC 223 The Individual, Society and the Environment

- BIOL 163 Science of the Environment

- ECON 225 Introduction to Environmental Economics

- PLSC 323 Issues in Environmental Policy

::: notes

As I mentioned, this class is the capstone for the "Designing Solutions for Environmental Problems" Fusion Certificate

- This is a professional certificate meant to give you a crash course to thinking about and, hopefully, addressing environmental problems

- The goal of these three pre-requisite courses is to set us up for success in this class

<br>

**SLIDE**: For those who haven't had the pleasure of the pre-reqs, let's ask the certificate students to tell us what they learned!

:::

::: notes

We just launched the brand new intro class for the certificate: The Individual, Society and the Environment

- Some of you got to take Dr. Browning's environmental ethics class on the way here, but moving forward this will be the entry point

<br>

In that class we explore:

- The contested concept of the environment, 
    
- The history of humanity's relationship to the environment and different ways of framing an environmental ethic, and
    
- Some of the pressing challenges facing us like environmental justice and the capitalist impulse to consume

<br>

**For those of you who just took this class with me, what did you take away from the class?**

<br>

**What kinds of assignments did I ask you to complete?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: The other intro class in the certificate focuses on the natural science

**Designing Solutions for Environmental Problems**

<br>

**Required Courses**

- PLSC 223 The Individual, Society and the Environment

- BIOL 163 Science of the Environment

- ECON 225 Introduction to Environmental Economics

- **PLSC 323 Issues in Environmental Policy**

::: notes

That brings us to the capstone experience, e.g. this class!

- In here we bring the politics and policy to the table in order to make a difference in our community

<br>

In other words, given the science, the economics and the political context of a given environmental problem, what can we feasibly do to address it?

<br>

**SLIDE**: Defining politics
:::




## {background-image="Images/01_1-politics1.png"}

::: notes

Given our large number of non-majors we should take a moment to define a key concept in our class: Politics

<br>

**Non-majors, when you hear someone say the sentence, "I really don't like politics", what are they talking about?**

- **What don't they like?**

<br>

**When we describe someone as "political" what are we saying about them?**

- **Is it a flattering description?**

- (**SLIDE**)

:::

![](Images/01_1-Politics_meme1_v3.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

The word politics these days is often attached to awful behavior by self-serving morons.

- That is decidedly not what we study in political science

- Or, that is not the only thing we study in political science

<br>

**SLIDE**: Rather than start with a technical definition, let's simulate a political problem related to the environment and see if that clears things up

:::

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '87%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_1-cartoon_lake.jpg")
```

::: notes

As a team-building exercise you have all decided to go on a one week camping trip together.

- While on a hike on the first day you come across a small lake stocked with fish

<br>

**Anybody like to go fishing?**

- **Are you good at it?**

- *Use volunteer, give a d12 and see if they can roll a 1-11 (92% chance of success)*

<br>

So, X goes fishing and successfully catches one fish

- As you eat the fish you get the distinct sense that you just earned extra credit in this class

- Congratulations! You've discovered a small lake of magical bonus point fish!

- Each fish you catch and consume adds 3 EC points on your final paper grade

- Catch 3 fish in our simulation, boost your final paper by almost a full letter grade

<br>

**Everybody with me so far?**

- **SLIDE**: Let's talk complications

:::



## Let's Manage a Resource {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

:::: {.r-fit-text}

::: {.incremental}

1. Seven day trip & fishing is a full day activity

2. p(Catch a fish) &#8595; as the number of fishers &#8593;

3. p(Catch a fish) &#8595; as the stock of fish &#8595;

4. p(Resource collapse) &#8593; as the amount of fishing &#8593;

:::

::::

::: notes

A few things I want you to keep in mind

<br>

**REVEAL**: Your camping trip lasts one week and you each will have the opportunity to fish every day (7 days)

<br>

**REVEAL**: Each day, your chance of catching a fish falls as the number of other people fishing goes up 

- Think added distractions and noise, lures, food, etc

<br>

**REVEAL**: Each day, your chance of catching a fish falls as the number of fish in the lake gets smaller

- Fewer fish available to catch makes it harder to catch one

<br>

**REVEAL**: This fishery is a finite, but sustainable, resource

- At a certain rate of fishing there are enough fish in the population to sustain a healthy and stable population

- If you remove fish beyond the maximum sustainable yield (MSY), the size of the fishery will decline over time

- If you remove too many fish, the fishery itself will collapse (insufficient stock to reproduce fast enough to survive)

<br>

**Any questions on the broad-strokes of the scenario?**

<br>

*Keep using the three groups from the board lists exercise*

- I'm going to ask each group to make a proposal to the class for how they would like us to manage this resource

- Groups, get ready to pitch us your plan

- **SLIDE**: Plan needs to specify...

:::



## Propose a Management Policy {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

1. How many fishers per day?

2. How should the fishers be chosen? 

3. How will you ensure compliance with these rules?

![](Images/01_1-cartoon_lake.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

**Any questions on the exercise?**

- Groups, get to brainstorming and get ready to pitch us on your plan.

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

- *Class chooses a plan*

<br>

*Run the simulation*

- *ON BOARD: 7 columns (one for each day) with space below for names*

- *Each day all fishers put name on board, roll for success and then circle the successes and strike out the fails*

- *P(Catch) depends on # of fishers PLUS remaining stock*
    
    - *Each fisher beyond 1 takes us down the d12 table (1 fisher needs <=11, 2 needs <=10, 3 needs <=9, etc)*
    
    - *Each 10 fish removed takes our starting point 1 down the d12 table*
    
- *You track total removed and at end let them know what happens to the fishery: Starting stock 100 fish, a MSY of 65 and a tipping point at 30*

**d12 probabilities**

cbind("Roll"=11:1, "Probs"=round(11:1/12, 2))

**What explains the outcome of our game?**
:::

::: notes

Everybody take a moment to reflect on our game.

- Get ready to explain, from your perspective, what just happened?

<br>

**Bottom line, why did we end up with the outcome of the game that we did?**

- **Biggest reason(s) in your mind?**

<br>

1. **Did everyone in class have the same goals?**

2. **Did making rules as a community help? Why or why not?**

3. **Did you worry much about compliance with the rules? Why or why not?**

4. **Did you care about the survival of the fishery? Why or why not?**

<br>

Games and simulations are often a useful tool for exploring politics.

- What we just played was a fairly basic resource distribution game.

- It highlights a ton of important stuff, but let me know draw out a few important ideas

<br>

**SLIDE**: Standard definitions of politics...
:::



## {background-image="Images/01_1-politics1_v1.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**1. Decision-making in a community**
:::

::: notes

One way that we study "politics" is by focusing on **how groups make decisions**.

- Group decision-making is complex and multi-layered

- It is also one of the **fundamental building blocks** of our society 

<br>

I set a fairly simple rule in your game, a majority vote.

- But that is FAR from the only way we could have done it! 
:::




## {background-image="Images/01_1-politics1_v1.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**2. How we make and enforce "the rules"**
:::

::: notes

A second way that we study "politics" is by focusing on **the rules**.

- Once a society has established rules, many political scientists study how those rules are interpreted, revised and enforced

- **The decision to punish a rule-breaker is a huge decision** that often sends ripples out through a community

<br>

**Out of curiosity, what would happen if today SGF police started pulling over EVERY car that exceeded the speed limit by even 1 mph?**

- **Seriously, walk me through how our community changes and reacts to that change in policy.**

<br>

**And what would happen if they completely stopped enforcing speed limits?**

- **Again, walk me through how our community changes and reacts to that change in policy.**

:::


## {background-image="Images/01_1-politics1_v1.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**3. Who gets what, when and how?**
:::

::: notes

A third way that we study "politics" is by focusing on **the distribution of costs and benefits**.

<br>

Why do groups form? 

- Often it is **to produce greater resources** than any individual could do on their own

    - This could be money, food, a division of labor, or collective security

- HOWEVER, producing that good means **someone has to pay** and someone has to benefit

<br>

Who pays and who benefits is **a constant tension** in any society.

<br>

Bottom line, anytime a group of people have to come together to make a decision, a political scientist can be found who is interested in the process.

- **Any questions on this broad definition of the concept "politics"?**

**Solving Environmental Problems in a Political World**
:::

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_1-environmental-issues.png")
```

::: notes

And that brings us to our primary aim in this class: 

- Our big goal this semester is to find a local environmental problem, learn a ton about it and then try to make a difference in it

<br>

I mean this. 

- My ambition is that we get out into the world and get something done.

- Will we succeed? Who knows! But let's give it a shot!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's wrap up today by touching base on my expectations for the course

## The answer is probably on Canvas {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_1-Canvas_Homepage.png")
```

::: notes

Everybody log into Canvas, open the syllabus and let's hit the highlights!

- *Give them time to do this*

<br>

1. **Any questions about the LOs or components of your grade?**

    - 90% is showing up and doing the daily work before class starts

2. **Any questions about the attendance policy?**
    
    - Attendance cliff (> 3 unexcused absences = Grade cap of 'C')
    
    - YOU are required to contact me by email for excused absences
    
    - Coach emails alone DO NOT COUNT

3. **Any questions about the participation points?**

    - MOST classes have short pre-class assignments that must be submitted to Canvas
    
    - Other ways to lose participation: Lateness, distracting classmates

<br>

The Modules page of our Canvas site is where I will provide all of the readings and links to the daily assignments.

- **Any question on the Modules page?**

<br>

Bottom line, please keep me in the loop this semester!

- I genuinely want you to make progress on our learning outcomes

- So, if things are getting rough for you please come talk to me.

- I will always offer you flexibility in the face of struggle IF YOU COME TO ME BEFORE DEADLINES HAVE PASSED!

<br>

**Questions on this?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: AI policy

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

![](Images/01_1-No_AI_Tools.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

You may not use any AI tools in this class. Any AI use will be treated as plagiarism.

<br>

That means: 

- No AI search

- No AI summaries of articles or books

- No AI for outlining or writing

- No AI for data analysis

- No AI to simply clean up your grammar (e.g. Grammarly).

<br>

Think of this class like training to play a sport

- The time you spend in the gym getting stronger and more flexible makes you a better athlete regardless of the sport you end up playing. 

- That's what we're doing in this class when we learn to critically analyze texts and become better writers.

- I'm getting you ready to succeed out in the real world

- Using AI tools is like bringing a forklift into the weight room. Yeah, you lifted the weights, but it was a waste of your time.

<br>

Other key point: Lots of people are worried about AI taking their jobs, e.g. replacing them in the workforce. 

- If you use AI to do your thinking for you then you are literally replacing yourself with AI

- You are setting yourself up with skills that are basically without value

<br>

So, let's not waste this opportunity working together this semester

- Let's get stronger and be better adapted to whatever the world looks like when you graduate

<br>
