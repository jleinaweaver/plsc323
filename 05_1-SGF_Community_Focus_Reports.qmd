Prep for Class

1. Review Canvas submissions

2. Copy theories generated in week 2 case studies to here

3. SGF Community Focus Reports
    - [2024 Report](https://springfieldcommunityfocus.org/2024_report/community-focus-report-2024.pdf)
    - [2021 Report](https://springfieldcommunityfocus.org/2021_report/springfield-community-focus-report-2021.pdf)
    - [2019 Report](https://springfieldcommunityfocus.org/2019_report/community-focus-2019-report.pdf)
    
4. Canvas Assignment Prompt: How effective has the Springfield community been in identifying and solving big problems? Read these reports in order to get a sense of how our community identifies and addresses big challenges. Don't just focus on the environmental stuff, it's all connected!
    1. Over the last five years, what are the THREE most impressive accomplishments identified in the Springfield Community Focus Reports?
    2. Over the last five years, what are THREE specific challenges we have been unable to address? Why do these stand out for you?

<br>

I have a few aims for us today:

1. We need to wrap up the key elements from the Munger chapter

2. We need to get a better sense of how Springfield functions as a community when faced with challenges, and

2. We should flag ongoing environmental challenges as identified by these reports

<br>

**SLIDE**: Last class we dug into the Munger chapter!

## Our Aim for This Week {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Problem-solving in a community requires policy!**

::: notes

Last class we began exploring the Munger chapter as a path into public policy

<br>

**According to the HunGats, why do we need public policy?**

- (Deciding collectively maximizes the odds of survival!)

<br>

**And, according to Munger, what are the pre-requisites we have to cover before we can hope to make successful policy?**

- (**SLIDE**)

:::

**Policymaking Pre-Requisites**

<br>

You must convince the community that:

1. We have a public problem, and

2. We require a collective decision to solve it
:::

::: notes

**What does it mean to argue that we have a public problem?**

- (My choices impact your welfare)

<br>

**And what does it mean to argue that we require a collective decision?**

- (Choices should be made by a group, and are binding on all)

<br>

Before we segue into the Community Focus Reports I want to wrap up our discussion of policy with a definition

- I'm not pretending this is the "correct" or "true" definition, but it is a useful place to start

- **SLIDE**

:::



## What is Policy? {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

"A definite course or method of action selected (as by a government, institution, group or individual) from among alternatives and in the light of given conditions to guide and usually determine present and future decisions..." (Webster's Third International Dictionary).

::: notes

Let's step through the key elements from this definition

:::



## What is Policy? {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

"A **definite course or method of action** selected (as by a government, institution, group or individual) from among alternatives and in the light of given conditions to guide and usually determine present and future decisions..." (Webster's Third International Dictionary).

::: notes

1) A policy, by definition, is a "definite" "course" or "method" of action

<br>

Makes sense if you think of policy as a new rule or set of rules

- Without specificity and clarity the policy cannot hope to change behavior

- e.g. Actor X must do Y

- e.g. Companies investing in new equipment must...

<br>

**SLIDE**: The alternatives
:::



## What is Policy? {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

"A definite course or method of action selected (as by a government, institution, group or individual) **from among alternatives** and in the light of given conditions to guide and usually determine present and future decisions..." (Webster's Third International Dictionary).

::: notes

2) A policy, by definition, is selected from among competing options

- There is NEVER just one answer to an environmental problem

- A BIG part of the reason a community typically has a problem in the first place is because there is dispute within that community over the possible answers

<br>

This means all policy, by definition, is choosing one set of rules over another

- Effective problem-solvers MUST be able to explain their choices in the context of the policies not selected

- In other words, you will be expected to have explicitly considered alternatives to your "definite" "course of action" AND be able to explain why you choose the way you did

<br>

**SLIDE**: conditions matter
:::

<br>

"A definite course or method of action selected (as by a government, institution, group or individual) from among alternatives and **in the light of given conditions** to guide and usually determine present and future decisions..." (Webster's Third International Dictionary).

::: notes

3) A policy, by definition, must be adapted to the important "conditions" of the problem

- In other words, the quality of your plan also DEPENDS on how well you've adapted it to the conditions on the ground.

- No one-size-fits-all policy solutions are appropriate here.

<br>

THIS is the danger of groups tied or committed to a specific ideology.

- Both cutting regulations and adding new ones are powerful options for influencing behavior, BUT

- It is the context of the problem that should guide your policy design, not vice versa!

- If you know the policy answer before you hear the problem you are not taking it seriously

<br>

**SLIDE**: stakeholders matter
:::

::: notes

4) A policy, by definition, "guide[s]" or "determine[s]" future behavior by stakeholders

- Stakeholders e.g. the people involved in the problem

<br>

This means your plan must be adapted to the context of now AND the expected context we face in the future

<br>

**SLIDE**: In sum
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

### To maximize your chances of success, your policy proposals must be:

::: {.r-fit-text}
- Specific,

- Adapted to the stakeholders,

- Adapted to the science of the problem, 

- Adapted to the rules of the community, and

- Be at least as good as the alternatives.
:::

::: notes
**Does all of that make sense?**

<br>

Everybody write this down and consider it a guide for our work this semester and especially for the final paper!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Funnily enough, Munger starts his chapter with a different definition

:::



## What should government do? {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

![](Images/02-1-Burke_Quote.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Munger kicks off his chapter with a longer version of this quote.

<br>

**What do you think of this as a definition of "government" or the purpose of "government"?**

- **By these terms, were you a government during our fishing simulation?**

<br>

Burke frames government as a human effort to deliver what we want

- Burke acknowledges that government is not "god-given" or part of the "natural order", it is a device built by us to achieve specific aims

- "contrivance": "the use of skill to bring something about or create something" (OED)

<br>

Importantly, this means that "government" is not impartial, perfect, or fixed in nature

- Governing is really hard.

- It is a human operation run by a community to achieve the goals of that community.

- In the simulation you were doing your best to manage a bunch of interests in the face of great uncertainty!

<br>

**SLIDE**: And I can't help but go from this to...

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

![](Images/02-1-Murray-make-a-difference.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Even MORE importantly, this means government is not separate from you.

- It is not a building far away or a special class of people

- It is the confusing name we apply to our community's efforts to solve problems

<br>

We live in a big, complicated country and its functioning well depends on you

- Problem-solving is in your hands

- The "decider" can be anyone, or any group, willing to put in the work 

- If you design a plan that meets the needs of its stakeholders and the conditions on the ground, you can make a difference

- THIS is how our government is designed to work

<br>

This is why we work on local environmental problems in here

- I want us tied to a specific community, in a specific moment in time and at a level where we can find concrete ways to make a difference.

<br>

**Questions on this?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: One other important baseline we need for working on policy

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**EVERY policy creates winners and losers**
:::

![](Images/02-1-winners.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Never forget, however, that in real-world problem-solving we play with live ammunition (so to speak)

<br>

Policy designers must NEVER forget that **all policies create winners and losers**.

+ Policy-making is **ALWAYS a choice** and **all choices have consequences**.

<br>

For example, Missouri just raised its minimum wage

- **Who benefits from increases to the minimum wage?**

- **Who pays the costs for those increases?**

- **Is there any way to pay workers more without distributing the costs to society?**

<br>

The same is true with environmental policies

- Take the clean air standards set by the Clean Air Act and the EPA

- **Who benefits from cleaner air?**

- **And who pays the costs for it?**

- **Is there any way to get cleaner air without impacting polluting industries?**

<br>

**Humor me, can we think of any policy or rule in our society whether implemented by government, school, or your employer, that does not impose costs on someone?**

<br>

So, policy is, in essence, a rule or rules adopted by a society to structure behavior.

- All rules impose costs on some and provide benefits to others

- Policy-making is often an exercise in deciding who will pay the costs and who will receive the benefits.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's talk about problem-solving in our backyard

Talk to me about these reports as sources of information about our community

- **What did you learn about these reports in terms of their validity and reliability based on how they present themselves in the writing?**

-*ON BOARD: Elements that boost your confidence vs elements that lower it*

<br>

- **Who are the sources of this information?**

- **Who decides on the topics to focus on? e.g. Who is the agenda setter?**

- **Who does the actual writing?**

- **What do you think of the caliber of the writing? Are these well written?**

**How do the SGF Community Focus Reports fit in the material we covered in the Munger chapter last class?**

- **What role are they trying to play in our community?**

**Policymaking Pre-Requisites**

<br>

1. We have a public problem, and

2. We require a collective decision to solve it
:::

::: notes

I see these reports VERY much as an effort to "decide how to decide"!

- The pre-reqs in action!

<br>

Let's keep these two tasks in mind later in our class today when we discuss the challenges you highlighted in your Canvas submissions

<br>

**SLIDE**: But first, let's start with what you identified as the "most impressive accomplishments" from the last three reports

:::





## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

### What are Springfield's "most impressive accomplishments" over the last five years?

::: notes

*ON BOARD: col 1 with room to match "why" to each in col 2*

- Help me list all of the "most impressive accomplishments" from the last three Springfield Community Focus Reports submitted to Canvas.

- Tell me what happened and in which report we can read about it

<br>

**Ok, analysis time. Why are these the "big" accomplishments?**

- **In other words, and based on this list, what are the criteria you were using for choosing what is and is not "impressive"?**

<br>

Don't forget to reflect on your own assumptions and biases along the way!

- **What do we learn from this list of criteria about you as a group of community problem-solvers?**

<br>

Remember, we have to constantly be interrogating our own assumptions as we go or we are liable to stumble into problems that could have been avoided.

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

### What do the reports highlight as the reasons for these "most impressive accomplishments"?

::: notes

*ON BOARD: col 2 next to each accomplishment*

- **Per the reports, what are the specific reasons we accomplished these "impressive" things? How do the reports explain them?**

<br>

**Any overlap in this list with the mechanisms we brainstormed using our case studies last week?**

- **Would we have been able to predict these using our theories of local problem-solving?**

<br>

*Class notes*

P(Success) increases when**

- The visibility of the problem increases
- The threat of harm is imminent
- The source of the problem is clear
- The greater the agreement on the cause of the problem
- The size of the impacted community is smaller
- The community has a greater sense of shared values
- The community has a demonstrated pattern of activism
- The community is more affluent
- The money available to act is greater
- The plan includes criteria for measuring effectiveness
- The plan includes greater levels of community involvment
- The plan changes incentives (carrots or sticks)

<br>

**SLIDE**: Challenges time!

:::




## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

### What are the "specific challenges we have been unable to address" over the last five years?

::: notes

*ON BOARD: col 3*

- Help me list all of the "specific challenges we have been unable to address" from the last three Springfield Community Focus Reports submitted to Canvas.

- Tell me what happened and in which report we can read about it

<br>

**Per the reports, why are we struggling to overcome these challenges?**

- **How do the reports explain the lack of progress?**

<br>

**Any overlap in this list with the mechanisms we brainstormed using our case studies last week?**

- **Would we have been able to predict these challenges using our theories of local problem-solving?**

<br>

Let's rank these challenges

- **Which specific challenges are the most important for Springfield to address? Why?**

- I know I'm asking for value-based judgements here, but I' understand that.'m curious to learn more about your values.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Evaluate the pre-reqs

**Policymaking Pre-Requisites**

<br>

You must convince the community that:

1. We have a public problem, and

2. We require a collective decision to solve it
:::

::: notes

Let's now talk about the role of these reports in the policymaking process.

<br>

**How effectively do you think these reports are making the pre-req arguments on these specific challenges?**

- **Which ones are they doing the best job with? Why?**

- **Which the weakest? Why?**

:::




## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

### How well equipped is Springfield to solve environmental problems?

::: notes

Big picture, where do we end up in our evaluation of Springfield as a community prepared to solve big problems?

<br>

**What kind of picture does the current report present of our local community?** 

- **e.g. big picture strengths and weaknesses?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Next week we need to collectively select the local environmental problem we are going to work on this semester

:::



## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

**Submit a local news story or other piece of evidence describing a current, local environmental problem we could work on this semester**

- No overlaps!

- Prompts on Canvas

::: notes

As a class we need to brainstorm a list of current, local environmental problems

- To kick us off on the brainstorming

- *Read the slide*

- Canvas has more of the details on the assignment page

<br>

**With that task in mind, what are the primary environmental problems we still face in our area as identified by the reports?**

- *ON BOARD*

<br>

**Any questions on the assignment?**

- Remember, no overlap! Let's build a big list of options!

<br>

Canvas: Local Environmental Problems

Help us brainstorm a list of current, local environmental problems. Submit a local news story or piece of evidence describing a current, local environmental problem you could target this semester. Do not overlap!

1. APA citation for the evidence

2. Describe the problem you've identified. Be as specific as you can in terms of who (or what) is being impacted and what those specific impacts are. (3+ sentences)

3. Make a short argument that we should select this problem as our focus for the semester (3+ sentences)
