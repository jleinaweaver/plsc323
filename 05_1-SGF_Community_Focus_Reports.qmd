*DON'T RACE THROUGH THIS; This review is important framing for evaluating the community focus reports*

<br>

Last week we explored three different approaches to community problem-solving.

<br>

**Big takeaways from our review of the Hughes plan: DOC'S KEY?**

- (A problem definition should not be confused with a preferred strategy, e.g. minimizing food waste is a strategy to achieve an outcome like reducing hunger in our community)

    - Avoid letting strategies be presented as the problem
    - Problems are neutral and don't typically need 'must' or 'should'
    
- "Useful objectives are specific, measurable, attainable, and reasonable; they also include an explicit timetable for completion" (p48).

- Taking the constraints seriously will help you design dynamic and realistic strategies
    
- (Multiple strategies should be developed and tested!)

- And so much more...

<br>

**Big takeaways from your review of the Clark and Peterson "Collaborative Approach"?**

- *The canvas responses covered this so make sure they respond!*

- Is an adaptive process
- Uses the most appropriate science and technology
- Is implementable
- Incurs low transaction costs
- Has appropriate funding
- Is measurable
- Is socially legitimate

<br>

**SLIDE**: From those processes I proposed the following

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

:::: {.r-fit-text}
**Engaging Productively as Problem-Solvers**

1) **Describe** the problem facing our community

2) **Investigate** the relevant stakeholders

3) **Frame** the problem

4) **Design** a policy to address the problem

5) Take **action** to push the plan forward!
::::

::: notes

**Any questions on this broad outline of a plan?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Then, last Thursday, we had guests!

![](Images/04_1-Brian_Fogle.png){.absolute width="300" right=150}

::: notes

**Takeaways from this chat?**

<br>

Question prompts I gave them:

1. Career path that brought you to us today? (education, work history, etc)
2. Megan: What does your day-to-day work at CPO entail?
3. What are the community problems you are most focused on currently?
4. Examples of policy or collaboration successes we can learn from?
5. Advice for getting "things" done in our community: 
- Sources of authority? 
- Primary movers and shakers? 
- Obstacles to be aware of? 
6. Places we can plug in to learn more and to get involved?

<br>

Ok, that wraps up our work in the first section of our class

- My hope is that you now have a basic grasp of the broad concepts and ideas we'll need to get to work in our community

- Our problem-solving efforts exist in a political arena and we are focused on issues that the key stakeholders will disagree about

- The good news is that basically no one in our community will disagree with the basic premise that the environment is important

- In that way, environmental problem solving tends to be both the easiest and the hardest community activity we can undertake

<br>

**REVEAL**

Our aim for Section 2 of the class is to get out into the community in order to help us select the environmental problem we will focus on in the second half of the semester

- Over the next few weeks we will meet with Drury reps, and volunteer with the Nature Center, the Watershed Committee and the Community Gardens

- Should be fun!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Our focus today is on the reporting SGF has been doing about its own efforts on the issues we care about

**Was this your first time reading any of these reports?**

- **Big picture, what did you think of them?**

<br>

*Encourage broad discussion on reflections*

Talk to me about these reports as sources of information about our community

- **What did you learn about these reports in terms of their validity and reliability based on how they present themselves in the writing?**

-*ON BOARD: Elements that boost your confidence vs elements that lower it*

<br>

- **Who are the sources of this information?**

- **Who decides on the topics to focus on? e.g. Who is the agenda setter?**

- **Who does the actual writing?**

- **What do you think of the caliber of the writing? Are these well written?**

<br>

**How do the SGF Community Focus Reports fit in the material we covered in the Munger chapter last class?**

- **What role are they trying to play in our community?**

- (**SLIDE**)

**Policymaking Pre-Requisites**

<br>

You must convince the community that:

1. We have a public problem, and

2. We require a collective decision to solve it
:::

::: notes

I see these reports VERY much as an effort to "decide how to decide"!

- The pre-reqs in action!

<br>

Let's keep these two tasks in mind later in our class today when we discuss the challenges you highlighted in your Canvas submissions

<br>

**SLIDE**: But first, let's start with what you identified as the "most impressive accomplishments" from the last three reports

:::





## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

### What are Springfield's "most impressive accomplishments" over the last five years?

::: notes

*ON BOARD: col 1 with room to match "why" to each in col 2*

- Help me list all of the "most impressive accomplishments" from the last three Springfield Community Focus Reports submitted to Canvas.

- Tell me what happened and in which report we can read about it

<br>

**Ok, analysis time. Why are these the "big" accomplishments?**

- **In other words, and based on this list, what are the criteria you were using for choosing what is and is not "impressive"?**

<br>

Don't forget to reflect on your own assumptions and biases along the way!

- **What do we learn from this list of criteria about you as a group of community problem-solvers?**

<br>

Remember, we have to constantly be interrogating our own assumptions as we go or we are liable to stumble into problems that could have been avoided.

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

### What do the reports highlight as the reasons for these "most impressive accomplishments"?

::: notes

*ON BOARD: col 2 next to each accomplishment*

- **Per the reports, what are the specific reasons we accomplished these "impressive" things? How do the reports explain them?**

<br>

**Any overlap in this list with the mechanisms we brainstormed using our case studies last week?**

- **Would we have been able to predict these using our theories of local problem-solving?**

<br>

*Class notes*

P(Success) increases when**

- The visibility of the problem increases
- The threat of harm is imminent
- The source of the problem is clear
- The greater the agreement on the cause of the problem
- The size of the impacted community is smaller
- The community has a greater sense of shared values
- The community has a demonstrated pattern of activism
- The community is more affluent
- The money available to act is greater
- The plan includes criteria for measuring effectiveness
- The plan includes greater levels of community involvment
- The plan changes incentives (carrots or sticks)

<br>

**SLIDE**: Challenges time!

:::




## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

### What are the "specific challenges we have been unable to address" over the last five years?

::: notes

*ON BOARD: col 3*

- Help me list all of the "specific challenges we have been unable to address" from the last three Springfield Community Focus Reports submitted to Canvas.

- Tell me what happened and in which report we can read about it

<br>

**Per the reports, why are we struggling to overcome these challenges?**

- **How do the reports explain the lack of progress?**

<br>

**Any overlap in this list with the mechanisms we brainstormed using our case studies last week?**

- **Would we have been able to predict these challenges using our theories of local problem-solving?**

<br>

Let's rank these challenges

- **Which specific challenges are the most important for Springfield to address? Why?**

- I know I'm asking for value-based judgements here, but I' understand that.'m curious to learn more about your values.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Evaluate the pre-reqs

**Policymaking Pre-Requisites**

<br>

You must convince the community that:

1. We have a public problem, and

2. We require a collective decision to solve it
:::

::: notes

Let's now talk about the role of these reports in the policymaking process.

<br>

**How effectively do you think these reports are making the pre-req arguments on these specific challenges?**

- **Which ones are they doing the best job with? Why?**

- **Which the weakest? Why?**

:::




## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

### How well equipped is Springfield to solve environmental problems?

::: notes

Big picture, where do we end up in our evaluation of Springfield as a community prepared to solve big problems?

<br>

**What kind of picture does the current report present of our local community?** 

- **e.g. big picture strengths and weaknesses?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Alright, let's talk next steps for us

:::



## Our Next Two Weeks {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center .smaller}

**Tuesday, Feb 17th**

- Volunteering at a SGF Community Garden

**Thursday, Feb 19th**

- Volunteering at the Nature Center

**Tuesday, Feb 24th**

- No Class

**Thursday, Feb 26th**

- Volunteering with the Watershed Committee

::: notes

Each volunteering gig is 2 hours, from 9:30-11:30a

- To pay you back for this extra time I will cancel class on Feb 24th

<br>

Successful completion of these exercises is worth 25 points on your grade per session

- A big portion of your final grade and all you have to do is show up and do some work improving the environment in our community!

<br>

If you need to leave early (e.g. when class normally ends), you need to talk to me about it ahead of time

<br>

The details for each session, or at least what I know so far, are on Canvas

- This includes the location, a contact or two and the broad strokes of the plan

- **Any questions on the plan?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: For next class

:::




## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Engaging with Campus Advocacy**

- The President's Council on Sustainability

- Think Green!

- Student Government Association

:::
::: notes

Next class we'll be inviting reps from these groups into our class

<br>

My aim is for us to pick their brains about:

1. The most pressing (short-term) environmental concerns on campus

2. The longer-term concerns on campus

3. Their experience of problem-solving on campus along with advice on getting things done, and

4. Their thoughts about engaging the student body on these issues

<br>

See you on Thursday!
