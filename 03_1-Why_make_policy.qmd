In our first class we simulated a resource management problem.

**What was the problem your community faced in our game?**

- (How to manage a renewable resource)
- (How to distribute benefits in a community)

<br>

**What "policy" or rules did you create?**

- **Even if you think the answer was "none" there were certainly norms of behavior you all obeyed! What norms were operating and why?**

<br>

**Were you, personally, happy with the outcome of the simulation? Why or why not?**

<br>

**Did the community maximize its benefits in this simulation?**

- **Depends on what you call a "benefit", right? Resource survival vs human utility...**

**"Politics" in everything**
:::

::: notes

Our first set of lessons about problem-solving in a community were introduced by our game

- As policy-makers you need to keep these lessons in mind

<br>

EVERY problem exists in a community, and every community is a complex mix of actors, rules and interactions

<br>

Most of you were strangers to each other when we played the game and yet your behavior was heavily influenced by the social dynamics and expectations YOU brought to it!

- This means that new rules and processes must be adapted to the rules and processes already in place
    - We all have to live together and even the "best" rules will fail if the community does not recognize them as legitimate

- This means that trust makes policy solutions MUCH easier to design!
    - Societies with a lack of trust are in for a rough time trying to solve problems.

<br>

**Is everybody clear on how "politics" plays a role in problem-solving?**

**The Trouble with Wilderness**
:::

::: notes

Last week we shifted our focus to a key concept in this class: The Environment.

<br>

**For the purposes of problem-solving, what is "the environment" and what do we need to keep in mind as we work?**

1. "The Environment", or whatever specific piece of it you are focusing on in problem-solving, is a human construct.
    - Cronon (1996) argues that ALL environmental concepts are constructed by people and their meanings evolve over time!

<br>

2. The root of many "environmental" conflicts is often a conflict in definitions
    - Stakeholders will almost certainly define the key concept in your problem differently.

    - This leads to actors arguing past each other

<br>
    
3. A good problem-solver must be flexible and adaptable which means not locking in on any single definition!
    - The key skill is learning to identify the stakeholders' definitions and knowing how to connect them!

    - We must design solutions that either work to align those competing framings OR that are consistent with all relevant definitions.

**We need policy!**
:::

::: notes

This week we need to **define "policy"** and think carefully about what it means to say that a problem **REQUIRES** a policy solution!

<br>

**Does everybody have the chapter from Munger's book?**

Michael Munger's *Analyzing Policy* is an excellent, although very technical book, all about learning to be a policy analyst.

<br>

**When you hear the word "policy," what immediately springs to mind?**

- **What are the "policy" examples that you've encountered?**

- (Laws and regulations by government)

- (Rules for behavior as a student at Drury)

- (Rules tied to your contract with your employer at work)

<br>

Ok, I'm about to show you a dictionary definition for the word "policy."

- Before I do, let's talk about the dictionary for a sec.

<br>

Dictionary definitions are a great place to start your learning

- They represent one kind of consensus about the meaning of words

- HOWEVER, they are extremely limited and constraining.

<br>

As a problem-solver, our interest is in understanding concepts in the context of a given community

- NOT imposing one dictionary specified consensus on them

- So, feel free to consult the dictionary but don't let it limit your engagement with real people and real problems

## Policy Defined {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

"A definite course or method of action selected (as by a government, institution, group or individual) from among alternatives and in the light of given conditions to guide and usually determine present and future decisions..." (Webster's Third International Dictionary).

::: notes

Let's step through the key elements from this definition

:::



## Policy Defined {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

"A **definite course or method of action** selected (as by a government, institution, group or individual) from among alternatives and in the light of given conditions to guide and usually determine present and future decisions..." (Webster's Third International Dictionary).

::: notes

1) A policy, by definition, is a "definite" "course" or "method" of action

<br>

Makes sense if you think of policy as a new rule or set of rules

- Without specificity and clarity the policy cannot hope to change behavior

- e.g. Actor X must do Y

- e.g. Companies investing in new equipment must...

<br>

**SLIDE**: The alternatives
:::



## Policy Defined {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

"A definite course or method of action selected (as by a government, institution, group or individual) **from among alternatives** and in the light of given conditions to guide and usually determine present and future decisions..." (Webster's Third International Dictionary).

::: notes

2) A policy, by definition, is selected from among competing options

- There is NEVER just one answer to an environmental problem

- A BIG part of the reason a community typically has a problem in the first place is because there is dispute within that community over the possible answers

<br>

This means all policy, by definition, is choosing one set of rules over another

- Effective problem-solvers MUST be able to explain their choices in the context of the policies not selected

- In other words, you will be expected to have explicitly considered alternatives to your "definite" "course of action" AND be able to explain why you choose the way you did

<br>

**SLIDE**: conditions matter

## Policy Defined {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

"A definite course or method of action selected (as by a government, institution, group or individual) from among alternatives and **in the light of given conditions** to guide and usually determine present and future decisions..." (Webster's Third International Dictionary).

::: notes

3) A policy, by definition, must be adapted to the important "conditions" of the problem

- In other words, the quality of your plan also DEPENDS on how well you've adapted it to the conditions on the ground.

- No one-size-fits-all policy solutions are appropriate here.

<br>

THIS is the danger of groups tied or committed to a specific ideology.

- Both cutting regulations and adding new ones are powerful options for influencing behavior, BUT

- It is the context of the problem that should guide your policy design, not vice versa!

- If you know the policy answer before you hear the problem you are not taking it seriously

<br>

**SLIDE**: stakeholders matter
:::

<br>

"A definite course or method of action selected (as by a government, institution, group or individual) from among alternatives and in the light of given conditions **to guide and usually determine present and future decisions**..." (Webster's Third International Dictionary).

::: notes

4) A policy, by definition, "guide[s]" or "determine[s]" future behavior by stakeholders

- Stakeholders e.g. the people involved in the problem

<br>

This means your plan must be adapted to the context of now AND the expected context we face in the future

<br>

**SLIDE**: In sum

## A useful policy proposal MUST: {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

- Be specific,

- Be adapted to the specific stakeholders,

- Be adapted to the conditions on the ground, and

- Include an evaluation of strong alternative proposals.

::: notes

Munger kicks off his chapter with a longer version of this quote.

<br>

**What do you think of this as a defintion of "government" or "policy"?**

- *Encourage reflection on this*

<br>

Burke frames government as a human effort to deliver what we want

- Burke acknowledges that government is not "god-given" or part of the "natural order", it is a device built by us to achieve specific aims

- "contrivance": "the use of skill to bring something about or create something" (OED)

<br>

In our resource management simulation there was no pre-existing government

- only a group of people seeking to develop some rule that could solve a problem for them.

- You tried to devise some rules to meet your wants

<br>

Importantly, this means that "government" is not impartial, perfect, or fixed in nature

- It is a human operation run by a community to achieve the goals of that community.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/02-1-Murray-make-a-difference.jpg")
```

::: notes

Even MORE importantly, this means government is not separate from you.

- It is not a building far away or a special class of people

- It is the confusing name we apply to our community's efforts to solve problems

<br>

We live in a big, complicated country and its functioning well depends on you

- Problem-solving is in your hands

- The "decider" can be anyone, or any group, willing to put in the work 

- If you design a plan that meets the needs of its stakeholders and the conditions on the ground, you can make a difference

- THIS is how our government is designed to work

<br>

This is why we work on local environmental problems in here

- I want us tied to a specific community, in a specific moment in time and at a level where we can find concrete ways to make a difference.

<br>

**Questions on this?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: One more bit of preamble before we dig into the Munger chapter more deeply

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/02-1-winners.jpg")
```

::: notes

Never forget, however, that in real-world problem-solving we play with live ammunition (so to speak)

<br>

Policy designers must NEVER forget that **all policies create winners and losers**.

+ Policy-making is **ALWAYS a choice** and **all choices have consequences**.

<br>

**For example, who benefits when government increases the minimum wage?**

**And who pays the costs for it?**

<br>

**Who benefits when the EPA introduces regulations meant to reduce smog in our cities?**

**And who pays the costs for it?**

<br>

**Who benefits when the city council puts speed limits on our roads?**

**And who pays the costs for it?**

<br>

**Humor me, can we think of any policy or rule in our society whether implemented by government, school, or your employer, that does not impose costs on someone?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Please keep these real world costs and benefits in mind as we now shift to what will feel like an incredibly abstract conversation about "wisdom"

**Everybody open up to Figure 2.1 in the Munger chapter**

<br>

I really appreciate how this figure connects our discussions last week about problem framing to policy design.

- As we noted last week, "framing" is like the packaging of a problem for sale

- Framing takes your simple, clear problem description and packages it with the important context / an easily digestible story

<br>

Last week I tried to make clear to you how powerful problem framing can be for problem-solving

- Today we step through how problem-framing creates path dependence 

- In simpler terms, getting the stakeholders to accept your framing is a huge step to getting them to accept your policy design

::: notes

In Figure 2.1 Munger focuses on three "tensions" that likely exist in any society when it comes to government action. 

- The three sources of "wisdom" here each represent a competing way to frame a policy problem

<br>

Each of these "sources of wisdom" represent different, pre-packaged framings you can apply to an environmental problem

- Each package asks you to view a given problem from a specific lens which carries with it guidance on why it matters, how it should be addressed and how it should be evaluated

<br>

Before you attempt to design a policy to address a problem you should be able to analyze that problem using each of the three "wisdoms."

<br>

**Does this make sense in big picture terms?**

<br>

*Split class into three groups and assign to each wisdom*

- Go sit with your group and claim a section of the board!
:::



## Introduce your "wisdom" {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

1. What are the "primary" causes of our problems?

2. What are the "best" kinds of policy designs?

3. What are the "right" criteria for evaluating effectiveness?

4. What are the strengths and weaknesses of this perspective?

::: notes

Groups, in 10 minutes I want you to introduce your "wisdom" to the class.

- I know the chapter discusses the wisdoms primarily by their tensions between each other, but I'd like you to zoom in on each wisdom separately

- In other words, focus on what would happen if we made your source the end-all and be-all of policy-making

<br>

**Questions on the four prompts?**

- Go!

<br>

Let's hear your answers!

- *Groups Present Each and DISCUSS*

<br>

The Market

- Pros: Most efficient by definition (most bang for the resource buck)
- Cons: Market failures such as 1) Monopolies (e.g. antitrust), 2) Externalities (e.g. pollution), 3) Under supply of public goods (e.g. free-riding), and 4) Information problems (e.g. drug safety); Reduces all problems to maximization of use issues

Experts: "someone who has the goal of improving the functioning of politics or markets" (31).

- Pros: Hopefully relies on transparent and verifiable knowledge; Plans built on expertise and designed with ongoing evaluation
- Cons: May discourage wide participation; May privilege some uses/solutions over others; May lead to inequitable outcomes depending on "who" the experts are

Politics

- Pros: Can be done to maximize participation; 
- Cons: Can be very slow; Can be very messy; Often has trouble with long time horizon problems

## {background-image="Images/01_1-cartoon_lake.jpg" .center}

::: notes

Think back to our resource management simulation.

- A community finds a renewable resource of fish they wish to consume

- Your job as a policy designer is to help that community manage the resource

<br>

This will mean guiding them in:

- The rules they create,

- The enforcement mechanisms they will require,

- The criteria they will use to monitor the plan's effectiveness,

- All while acknowledging some will benefit and others will pay the costs!

<br>

Let's practice this exercise using the "wisdoms" we've been reviewing
:::



## Applying the "Wisdoms" {background-image="Images/03_1-Cartoon_Lake_v2.png" .center}

<br>

1. Propose a policy to manage this resource

2. Explain the criteria we should use to monitor its effectiveness

3. Identify who in our society will benefit and who will pay the costs

::: notes

Groups, take a few minutes to think about our management problem from the perspective of your assigned wisdom.

- I'd like each group to apply their wisdom to the problem in order to tell us these three things

<br>

1. What would the policy look like?

2. How would we know if it is working?

3. How are the costs and benefits distributed in this plan?

<br>

**Questions?**

- Go!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*
:::



## {background-image="Images/01_1-cartoon_lake.jpg" .center}

**So, where do we end up?**

- **Which plan appeals most to you? Why?**

<br>

**SLIDES**: *Conflicts between the wisdoms*

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/02-1-Munger_Fig2-1-efficiency.png")
```

::: notes

Now, Munger argues that many policy debates come from the conflicts between these sources of wisdom.

<br>

When experts try to "fix" market failures we get efficiency policies.
- e.g. How do we distribute the rewards to ensure no better distribution is possible?

- e.g. How can expert tweaks to the market reduce market failures?

<br>

**Can we see this specific tension when we compare the plans from the market and expert groups?**

<br>

**How much room for compromise here?**

When politics tries to "fix" market failures we get equity policies.
- Disagreements about the outcomes of market processes

- e.g. Fairness

<br>

**Can we see this specific tension when we compare the plans from the market and politics groups?**

<br>

**How much room for compromise here?**

2. "Fair" as in equitable

+ Often implicate the very functioning of your government or democracy

```

::: notes
**Any questions or need for clarification on the sources of wisdom?**

- **Does everybody understand the value of thinking through a specific problem three times, once per "wisdom"?**

<br>

Bottom line, there is no free lunch!

- Each perspective promotes a type of policy design but each policy design creates costs for somebody in society

<br>

HOPEFULLY, this helps you start to better understand why no single "wisdom" is always the "right" answer

- If a single source ALWAYS "wins" then you create a wild imbalance in society (e.g. all costs to one type of group and all benefits to one type of group repeated forever)

<br>

This triangle offers us a helpful way to think about disputes over problem framing

- As you analyze the stakeholders involved in any environmental problem you will have a better understanding of who they are and what they want if you can figure out where they fit here.

## {background-image="Images/02-1-cavemen.jpg" .center}

::: notes

Let's now shift to one of my favorite thought experiments in any textbook ever.

<br>

**What is the Hun-gats tribe thought experiment?**

- **What details stood out for you?**

- A tribe of hunter-gatherers in pre-history that are running out of food (or at least the food they know is safe to eat)

- Option: They can stay independent and "free" (every man for himself), but that will almost certainly wipe them out

- Option: Create policy to share risk and increase chances of survival over time

<br>

Now analyze it for me!

**What are the concrete lessons we can take from the starving Hun-gats tribe to help us be better policy-makers?**

- *Don't dawdle setting this up or debating the state of nature. Get to the point. They read it so ask what the takeaways are!*

<br>

1. The "state of nature" baseline is probably a stupid one as it never could have existed (not even in this thought experiment)
    - Munger implies that a "state of nature" represents the absence of any market, expert or political "context" in a given situation (p35).

2. The desire to survive appears to make policy a necessity

3. Battles over expertise are central to policy-making

4. Policy can only ever be as effective as the authority that compels the behavior, e.g. the birth of religious rules?

5. Any society with resource issues will deal with free-riding problems

<br>

I really appreciate how this distills down to the fundamental basics of how any human society functions.

- The creation of policy helps maximize the odds of survival

::: notes

In Figure 2.3 Munger lays out his "three stages of policy choice."

- This figure specifies the three steps involved in pushing a community to address a problem

<br>

In essence, Munger's three steps are:

1. Convince the community there is a problem,

2. Convince the community it should be addressed collectively, and

3. Convince the community of how the specific policy should be adopted

<br>

Fundamentally, this figure is a reminder for all policymakers

- BEFORE you try to solve a problem, you MUST make a number of convincing arguments

<br>

**SLIDE**: For our purposes, I'm going to boil these down to two steps that I will ask you to include in your reports this semester

:::



## We Need a Policy {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Argument 1:** This is a public problem

<br>

**Argument 2:** This requires a collective decision
:::

::: notes

Before you can propose a policy solution you must first convince the relevant community of two things:
1. The issue is a public problem, and

2. It requires a collective decision.

<br>

**What does it mean to say something is a "public" problem?**

- **As opposed to what?**

- (**SLIDE**)
:::



## 1. This is a public problem {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

**Private Problem**

- "My choice has no consequence for your welfare"

**Public Problem**

- "My choices affect your welfare"

::: notes

Note that for clarity I am referring to these as debates about the problem

- In Munger's Figure 2.4 he labels these "decisions" which I find a little confusing

<br>

**Give me an example of something in your life that is clearly a "private problem" by this definition.**

<br>

**Now give me an example of something in your life that is clearly a "public problem" by this definition.**

<br>

**How distinct are these two things?**

- **Is it likely the case that people easily agree the difference between public and private problems?**

::: notes

Munger's Figure 2.4 combines these two arguments in order to convey more important lessons for us as policymakers and problem-solvers.

- **Groups, reflect on this 2x2 grid and report back to me on how this helps us solve problems**

<br>

**What do you get from this?**

- **How does this help us think about problem-solving in a community?**

<br>

Different combinations of positions on our two baseline arguments lead to VERY different views of any specific problem

- Figuring out how a stakeholder thinks about your problem along these two dimensions can offer very powerful insights for you about them.

- Issue framings are typically powerful and often connect minor issues to loaded ideas and identities

- A person who views the issue you are calling "a problem" who believes it is an issue of their "individual liberty" is NOT someone who is going to be excited to hear about your new plan, right?

<br>

These boxes represent shortcuts to analyzing a stakeholder
- When a stakeholder uses language like in these four boxes they are telling you a ton about who they are, what they identify with and what they value!

- Think carefully about these messages as a means to helping you think through moving their willingness to compromise.

<br>

These boxes represent shortcuts to moving the views of a stakeholder

- Taking on one of these at a time will be easier than trying to tackle both framing problems simultaneously

- Keeping these discussions distinct can be a useful strategy

- e.g. first establishing that someone's choices affect community welfare AND THEN making a separate case that the community should decide

<br>

**Make sense?**

::: notes

If your goal is to solve actual problems facing a real community then an effective policy designer must be flexible and empathetic to the needs and views of the stakeholders in the community.

<br>

We live in a complex and diverse society filled with lots of different people living in very close quarters.

- Our job is to figure out where they are, what they want and how we can help them solve problems using policies that EVERYONE will accept and obey over time.
