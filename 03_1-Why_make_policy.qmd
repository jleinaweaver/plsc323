::: notes

In our first class we simulated a resource management problem.

**What was the problem your community faced in our game?**

- (How to manage a renewable resource)
- (How to distribute benefits in a community)

<br>

**What rules did you create? Why?**

- **e.g. number of fishers, selection of fishers, enforcement of the rules?**

<br>

**Was this management effort a success? Why or why not?**

<br>

- **Were you maximizing the sustainability of the resource, the gains of the collective or the gains of one individual?**

<br>

I really like this opening simulation for a bunch of reasons:

- It gives me a sense of who each of you are as individuals

- It gives me a sense of who you are as a collective

- It asks each of you to think about a community problem like a political scientist

- And, frankly, it's a lot of fun

<br>

**SLIDE**: But there are also some lessons on problem-solving we should keep in mind

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**1) The Basics of Problem-Solving in a Community**
:::

<br>

Politics in everything!

- EVERY problem exists in a community, and 

- EVERY community is a complex mix of actors, rules and interactions

::: notes

*Read slide*

<br>

Each proposal for managing the resource was evaluated by the class in terms of the rules and processes they already operate within

- This means that new rules and processes must be adapted to the rules and processes already in place

<br>

Each proposal was altered based on the other proposals!

- We all have to live together and even the "best" rules will fail if the community does not recognize them as legitimate

<br>

You guys were rather eager to jump to murder as a means for enforcing the rules

- This means that trust is a vital component of creating rules that will work

- Societies with a lack of trust are in for a rough time trying to solve problems.

<br>

**Is everybody clear on the importance of thinking about the "politics" when problem-solving?**

- As policy-makers you need to keep these lessons in mind

**The Trouble with Wilderness**

::: notes

After the simulation we shifted our focus to a big collection of key ideas discussed in the Cronon piece from 1996.

<br>

**For the purposes of problem-solving, what is "the trouble with wilderness" and what do we need to keep in mind as we work?**

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**1) The Basics of Problem-Solving in a Community**

<br>

**The Trouble with Wilderness**

1. The "environment" is a contested concept

2. "Conflict" is often due to conflicting definitions

3. **YOU** have to be curious and adaptable
:::

::: notes


1. "The Environment", or whatever specific piece of it you are focusing on in problem-solving, is a human construct.

    - Cronon (1996) argues that ALL environmental concepts are constructed by people and their meanings evolve over time!

<br>

2. The root of many "environmental" conflicts is often a conflict in definitions

    - Stakeholders will almost certainly define the key concept in your problem differently.

    - This leads to actors arguing past each other

<br>
    
3. A good problem-solver must be flexible and adaptable which means not locking in on any single definition!

    - The key skill is learning to identify the stakeholders' definitions and knowing how to connect them!

    - We must design solutions that either work to align those competing framings OR that are consistent with all relevant definitions.

## Our Aim for This Week {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Problem-solving in a community requires policy!**
:::

![](Images/03_1-Public-Policy-Research.jpg){.absolute bottom=25 left=100 width="800"}

::: notes

This week we need to **define "policy"** and think carefully about what it means to say that a problem **REQUIRES** a policy solution!

<br>

For today I assigned you a chapter from Michael Munger's *Analyzing Policy* book

- Munger's book is an excellent read for anyone interested in becoming a policy analyst or policymaker.

- Munger makes a series of arguments about policymaking that I want us to unpack together and then evaluate

- We should keep the parts we think will be useful and discard the others

<br>

Let's set the table first in a big picture way.

- **When you hear the word "policy," what immediately springs to mind?**

    - **What are the "policy" examples that you've encountered?**

- (Laws and regulations by government)

- (Rules for behavior as a student at Drury)

- (Rules tied to your contract with your employer at work)

<br>

**SLIDE**: "Requires" is a strong claim here, so let's discuss it.

:::



## {background-image="Images/02-1-cavemen.jpg" .center}

::: notes

Let's start with Munger's discussion of the hypothetical Hun-gats tribe (p40-47)

- This is absolutely one of my favorite thought experiments

<br>

**Talk to me about the tribe. What details stood out for you in this thought experiment?**

<br>

- **What dilemma was the tribe facing?**

- **What options were available to them and what were the pros and cons of each?**

- **What does Munger suggest they, and all societies, must do to survive?**

<br>

A tribe of hunter-gatherers in pre-history that are running out of food (or at least the food they know is safe to eat)

- Option: They can stay independent and "free" (every man for himself), but that will almost certainly wipe them out

- Option: Create policy to share risk and increase chances of survival over time

<br>

**Why is Munger telling us this story?**

- **What does he hope aspiring policy analysts will learn from this?**

- (**SLIDE**: *These bullets on next slide*)
    1. There was never a "state of nature"
    2. Survival makes policy a necessity
    3. Battles over expertise are unavoidable
    4. Policy effectiveness depends on authority

**The Lessons of the Hun-gats**

1. There was never a "state of nature"

2. Survival makes policy a necessity

3. Battles over expertise are unavoidable

4. Policy effectiveness depends on authority

:::
::::

::: notes

**REVEAL 1**: The "state of nature" baseline is probably a stupid one as it never could have existed (not even in this thought experiment)

<br>

Think back to our simulation on the first day of class.

- Most of you were strangers to each other when we played the game and yet your behavior was HEAVILY influenced by:

    - Your individual expectations for how you will do in this class (e.g. is EC valuable or not?),

    - Your individual needs for progress towards your longer-term goals (graduation, grad school, etc)

    - Your desire to be seen by the rest of the group in a particular way (classmates and professor)

    - Your sense of how classrooms in college are supposed to function (e.g. what are the rules of behavior?)

    - Your desire (maybe?) to not exterminate a species

    - and so much more...

<br>

There is no "starting from scratch" anywhere in human societies!

- All new policies are built on top of a mess of established policies and there's no avoiding that

<br>

**REVEAL 2**: Survival odds are maximized by sharing risks and benefits in a community

- Socialism for the win, eh?

- Community's require rules to function

<br>

**REVEAL 3**: Battles over expertise are central to policy-making

- There is no single, perfect standard for evaluating outcomes

- Different perspectives and interests will prefer different standards

<br>

**REVEAL 4**: Policy can only ever be as effective as the authority that compels the behavior, e.g. the birth of religious rules?

<br>

**Is everybody clear on these four "lessons"?**

## Our Aim for This Week {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Problem-solving in a community requires policy!**
:::

![](Images/03_1-Public-Policy-Research.jpg){.absolute bottom=25 left=100 width="800"}

::: notes

Back to the big argument!

- *Key discussion number 1, encourage this debate*

<br>

**Are you persuaded that problem-solving in a community requires policy? Why or why not?**

- **In other words, could you imagine a functional society that operated in the absence of policy? Why or why not?**
    
<br>
    
**Are there elements of Munger's thought experiment you think are problematic for supporting this argument? Why or why not?**

<br>

Bottom line, I really appreciate how Munger's thought experiment distills down to the fundamental basics of how any human society functions.

- The creation of policy helps maximize the odds of survival

<br>

**SLIDE**: That takes us to the second policymaking argument we need to evaluate

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

### Problem-solving in a community requires policy, but policymaking has pre-requisites!


![](Images/02-1-Munger_Fig2-3.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Just because you now accept that a problem is serious and needs policy to address it, doesn't mean the community is on board!

- In Figure 2.3 Munger lays out his "three stages of policy choice"

- aka "Deciding How to Decide"

<br>

In essence, Munger's three steps are:

1. Convince the community that there is a problem,

2. Convince the community that it should be addressed collectively, and

3. Convince the community of how the specific policy should be adopted

<br>

Fundamentally, this figure is a reminder for ALL policymakers: **BEFORE you try to solve ANY problem, you MUST make a number of convincing arguments**

<br>

**SLIDE**: For our purposes, I'm going to boil these down to two distinct steps I'm describing as the pre-requisites of policy

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Policymaking Pre-Requisites**

<br>

You must convince the community that:

1. We have a public problem, and

2. We require a collective decision to solve it
:::

::: notes

Each pre-requisite is a distinct argument that you have to successfully make before moving to any actual policy-design

<br>

In other words, before we can debate rules, new taxes, subsidies or anything else you first must succeed in convincing the community that collective action is needed.

- This is NOT an easy step, but the better you do this the easier the rest of the process becomes.

<br>

Let's start with the first of these

- **SLIDE**: What does it mean to argue that we have a public problem?

:::



## Policymaking Pre-Requisite 1 {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Private Problem**

- "My choice has no consequence for your welfare"

**Public Problem**

- "My choices affect your welfare"

:::

::: notes

First you must establish who is being impacted by the choices that are creating the problem, as you see it

- Note that for clarity I am referring to these as debates about the "problem" instead of "decisions" as Munger does in the chapter

<br>

**Give me an example of something in your life that is clearly a "private problem" by this definition.**

<br>

**Now give me an example of something in your life that is clearly a "public problem" by this definition.**

<br>

**How distinct are these two things?**

- **Is it likely the case that people easily agree the difference between public and private problems?**

<br>

- **Give me an example of a problem that straddles the line between public and private these days**

<br>

Ok, so you've convinced the community that we have a public problem, now what?

- **SLIDE**: Now we make the argument that this problem requires a collective decision to solve it
:::


## Policymaking Pre-Requisite 2 {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Individual Decision**

- "I can choose, alone and without interference"

**Collective Decision**

- "Choices are made by a group, and are binding on all"
:::

::: notes
The second pre-requisite is that you convince the community that this problematic "choice" should be governed by rules set by us all collectively.

<br>

**Give me an example of something in your life that should definitely remain an "individual decision" by this definition.**

<br>

**Now give me an example of something in your life that should absolutely require a "collective decision" by this definition.**

<br>

**How distinct are these two things?**

- **Is it likely the case that people easily agree the difference between individual and collective decision problems?**

<br>

- **Give me an example of a problem that straddles the line**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Set up the practice exercise

:::

**Policymaking Pre-Requisites**

<br>

You must convince the community that:

1. We have a public problem, and

2. We require a collective decision to solve it
:::

::: notes

**Ok, any questions on the two pre-requisites we must complete?**

<br>

Let's practice making these kinds of arguments

- *Split class into three groups*

- Go sit with your group and claim some space on the board!

<br>

**SLIDE**: We're going back to the magical fishery!

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Does our magical fishery require public policy?**
:::

![](Images/01_1-cartoon_lake.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Each group will have ten minutes to put on the board the strongest argument they can that supports one of three possible answers to this question

- Group 1, your conclusion is that the magical fishery is a private problem that should be left to the individual to manage

- Group 2, your conclusion is that the magical fishery is a public problem, BUT it should still be left to the individual to manage

- Group 3, your conclusion is that the magical fishery is a public problem, AND it should be managed collectively

<br>

**Everybody clear on the job?**

- Go!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

- **What advice can we offer each group to help them strengthen their argument?**

<br>

**Out of curiosity, and in terms of our fishery, which of these do you find the most convincing? Why?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Persuason as setting the foundation for policymaking

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Moving Group 1 to Group 2**

:::

- Group 1: The magical fishery is a private problem that should be left to the individual to manage

- Group 2: The magical fishery is a public problem, BUT it should still be left to the individual to manage

::: notes

Now that we've mapped out the obstacles, our job is to work to overcome them!

<br>

Typically, your first job is to develop consensus in the community around the idea that we have a public problem (not private).

- This means not yet challenging the belief that this is none of your business!

<br>

**Ok, let's brainstorm from strategies for moving someone from Group 1 to Group 2**

- *DISCUSS*

<br>

**Does everybody understand why we start with Group 1 and not Group 2?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Now the usually much harder job!

:::

**Moving Group 2 to Group 3**

:::

- Group 2: The magical fishery is a public problem, BUT it should still be left to the individual to manage

- Group 3: The magical fishery is a public problem, AND it should be managed collectively

::: notes

**What kinds of argument would you suggest for the second type, e.g. moving someone from Group 2 to Group 3?**

- *DISCUSS*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Evaluating the second argument

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

**Policymaking Pre-Requisites**

<br>

You must convince the community that:

1. We have a public problem, and

2. We require a collective decision to solve it
:::

::: notes

Alright, now we need to evaluate this second big argument.

<br>

**Are you convinced that these are the required pre-requisites for policymaking in a community? Why or why not?**

- **What is the value in mapping out the positions like this before starting policymaking?**

<br>

- **And what is the value in spending time and effort moving the groups BEFORE beginning policymaking?**

<br>

Bottom line, I am convinced that this pre-requisite stage represents incredibly important time spent laying the foundation for future success in a community: 

- Find the stakeholders, learn about their framings, identify obstacles and work to smooth them!

<br>

**SLIDE**: So we're going to make a policy, but which "policy" is the wise one?

::: notes

**What would it mean to adopt the markets as your primary "wisdom" for policymaking?**

- **In other words, how might a markets-focus be used to solve environmental problems?**

<br>

Preference for allocating resources AND solving problems using systems of private exchange. 

- Concerned primarily with process, less so with outcomes

- Preference for non-interventionist style policies wherever possible

- Rules only to keep that market well functioning (contract enforcement, etc)

<br>

**What would a market-based solution to our magical fishery resource look like?**

- **How many fishers? Who fishes? What about enforcement?**

<br>

**According to the chapter, what are the pros and cons of prioritizing a markets focus over the others?**

Pros: 

- Most efficient by definition (most bang for the resource buck)

<br>

Cons - Market failures such as:

1) Monopolies (e.g. antitrust), 

2) Externalities (e.g. pollution), 

3) Under supply of public goods (e.g. free-riding), and 

4) Information problems (e.g. drug safety); Reduces all problems to maximization of use issues

**Policymaking Pre-Requisites**

<br>

You must convince the community that:

1. We have a public problem, and

2. We require a collective decision to solve it
:::

::: notes

Let's go back to our pre-requisite arguments on the boards!

<br>

The big question becomes how can we use the wisdoms to help us persuade a community to accept that we have a public problem that requires a collective action?

<br>

**FIRST, can we recognize the wisdoms in the arguments being made?**

- *Encourage this discussion: find examples of all three!*

<br>

**SECOND, how do the wisdoms help us tailor arguments for moving Groups 1 and 2 into Group 3?**

- *Encourage this discussion: find examples of all three!*

<br>

Ironically, I want to end today by discussing one particular definition of the main concept we've been discussing all class-long: "policy"

- I'm not pretending this is the "correct" or "true" definition, but it is a useful place to start

- **SLIDE**

:::



## What is Policy? {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

"A definite course or method of action selected (as by a government, institution, group or individual) from among alternatives and in the light of given conditions to guide and usually determine present and future decisions..." (Webster's Third International Dictionary).

::: notes

Let's step through the key elements from this definition

:::



## What is Policy? {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

"A **definite course or method of action** selected (as by a government, institution, group or individual) from among alternatives and in the light of given conditions to guide and usually determine present and future decisions..." (Webster's Third International Dictionary).

::: notes

1) A policy, by definition, is a "definite" "course" or "method" of action

<br>

Makes sense if you think of policy as a new rule or set of rules

- Without specificity and clarity the policy cannot hope to change behavior

- e.g. Actor X must do Y

- e.g. Companies investing in new equipment must...

<br>

**SLIDE**: The alternatives
:::



## What is Policy? {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

"A definite course or method of action selected (as by a government, institution, group or individual) **from among alternatives** and in the light of given conditions to guide and usually determine present and future decisions..." (Webster's Third International Dictionary).

::: notes

2) A policy, by definition, is selected from among competing options

- There is NEVER just one answer to an environmental problem

- A BIG part of the reason a community typically has a problem in the first place is because there is dispute within that community over the possible answers

<br>

This means all policy, by definition, is choosing one set of rules over another

- Effective problem-solvers MUST be able to explain their choices in the context of the policies not selected

- In other words, you will be expected to have explicitly considered alternatives to your "definite" "course of action" AND be able to explain why you choose the way you did

<br>

**SLIDE**: conditions matter

"A definite course or method of action selected (as by a government, institution, group or individual) from among alternatives and **in the light of given conditions** to guide and usually determine present and future decisions..." (Webster's Third International Dictionary).

::: notes

3) A policy, by definition, must be adapted to the important "conditions" of the problem

- In other words, the quality of your plan also DEPENDS on how well you've adapted it to the conditions on the ground.

- No one-size-fits-all policy solutions are appropriate here.

<br>

THIS is the danger of groups tied or committed to a specific ideology.

- Both cutting regulations and adding new ones are powerful options for influencing behavior, BUT

- It is the context of the problem that should guide your policy design, not vice versa!

- If you know the policy answer before you hear the problem you are not taking it seriously

<br>

**SLIDE**: stakeholders matter

4) A policy, by definition, "guide[s]" or "determine[s]" future behavior by stakeholders

- Stakeholders e.g. the people involved in the problem

Munger kicks off his chapter with a longer version of this quote.

<br>

**What do you think of this as a definition of "government" or the purpose of "government"?**

- **By these terms, were you a government during our fishing simulation?**

<br>

Burke frames government as a human effort to deliver what we want

- Burke acknowledges that government is not "god-given" or part of the "natural order", it is a device built by us to achieve specific aims

- "contrivance": "the use of skill to bring something about or create something" (OED)

<br>

Importantly, this means that "government" is not impartial, perfect, or fixed in nature

- Governing is really hard.

- It is a human operation run by a community to achieve the goals of that community.

- In the simulation you were doing your best to manage a bunch of interests in the face of great uncertainty!

Even MORE importantly, this means government is not separate from you.

- It is not a building far away or a special class of people

- It is the confusing name we apply to our community's efforts to solve problems

<br>

We live in a big, complicated country and its functioning well depends on you

- Problem-solving is in your hands

- The "decider" can be anyone, or any group, willing to put in the work 

- If you design a plan that meets the needs of its stakeholders and the conditions on the ground, you can make a difference

- THIS is how our government is designed to work

<br>

This is why we work on local environmental problems in here

- I want us tied to a specific community, in a specific moment in time and at a level where we can find concrete ways to make a difference.

**EVERY policy creates winners and losers**

::: notes

Never forget, however, that in real-world problem-solving we play with live ammunition (so to speak)

<br>

Policy designers must NEVER forget that **all policies create winners and losers**.

+ Policy-making is **ALWAYS a choice** and **all choices have consequences**.

<br>

For example, Missouri just raised its minimum wage

- **Who benefits from increases to the minimum wage?**

- **Who pays the costs for those increases?**

- **Is there any way to pay workers more without distributing the costs to society?**

<br>

The same is true with environmental policies

- Take the clean air standards set by the Clean Air Act and the EPA

- **Who benefits from cleaner air?**

- **And who pays the costs for it?**

- **Is there any way to get cleaner air without impacting polluting industries?**

<br>

**Humor me, can we think of any policy or rule in our society whether implemented by government, school, or your employer, that does not impose costs on someone?**

<br>

So, policy is, in essence, a rule or rules adopted by a society to structure behavior.

- All rules impose costs on some and provide benefits to others

- Policy-making is often an exercise in deciding who will pay the costs and who will receive the benefits.
