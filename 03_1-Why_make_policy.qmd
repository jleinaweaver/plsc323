::: notes

Refresh my memory!

- In our first class we simulated a resource management problem.

<br>

**One more time, what was the problem your community faced in our game?**

- (How to manage a renewable resource)

- (How to distribute benefits in a community)

<br>

**In what ways can we think of this as a successful community effort in resource management?**

- **In other words, tell me the success story version of what happened**

<br>

Now reverse it!

- **In what ways can we think of this as a failed effort in resource management?**

- (Maximize individual results!)

<br>

**And what were the key lessons for us of this simulation?**

- (**SLIDE**)

::: {.r-fit-text}
**1) The Basics of Problem-Solving in a Community**
:::

<br>

Politics in everything!

- EVERY problem exists in a community, and 

- EVERY community is a complex mix of actors, rules and interactions

::: notes

*Read slide*

<br>

Each proposal for managing the resource was evaluated by the class in terms of the rules and processes they already operate within

- This means that new rules and processes must be adapted to the rules and processes already in place

<br>

Each proposal was altered based on the other proposals!

- We all have to live together and even the "best" rules will fail if the community does not recognize them as legitimate

<br>

You guys were rather eager to jump to murder as a means for enforcing the rules

- This means that trust is a vital component of creating rules that will work

- Societies with a lack of trust are in for a rough time trying to solve problems.

<br>

**Is everybody clear on the importance of thinking about the "politics" when problem-solving?**

- As policy-makers you need to keep these lessons in mind

**The Trouble with Wilderness**
:::

::: notes

After the simulation we shifted our focus to a big collection of key ideas discussed in the Cronon piece from 1996.

<br>

**For the purposes of problem-solving, what is "the trouble with wilderness" and what do we need to keep in mind as we work?**

- (**SLIDE**)

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**1) The Basics of Problem-Solving in a Community**

<br>

**The Trouble with Wilderness**

1. The "environment" is a contested concept

2. "Conflict" is often due to conflicting definitions

3. **YOU** have to be curious and adaptable
:::

::: notes


1. "The Environment", or whatever specific piece of it you are focusing on in problem-solving, is a human construct.

    - Cronon (1996) argues that ALL environmental concepts are constructed by people and their meanings evolve over time!

<br>

2. The root of many "environmental" conflicts is often a conflict in definitions

    - Stakeholders will almost certainly define the key concept in your problem differently.

    - This leads to actors arguing past each other

<br>
    
3. A good problem-solver must be flexible and adaptable which means not locking in on any single definition!

    - The key skill is learning to identify the stakeholders' definitions and knowing how to connect them!

    - We must design solutions that either work to align those competing framings OR that are consistent with all relevant definitions.
    
<br>

**Is everybody clear on how "the environment" plays a role in problem-solving?**

After exploring the Cronon piece we shifted into a comparative case study exercise

<br>

**For the purposes of problem-solving, what did we learn from our success and failure case studies last week?**

- **Are there certain kinds of environmental problem, community or policy approach that is more or less likely to succeed?**

<br>

- (**SLIDE**: Examples from week 2)

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .smaller}

**P(Success) increases when**

- The visibility of the problem increases
- The threat of harm is imminent
- The source of the problem is clear (and widely accepted)
- The size of the impacted community is smaller
- The community has a greater sense of shared values
- The community has a demonstrated pattern of activism
- The community is more affluent
- The money available to act is greater
- The plan includes criteria for measuring effectiveness
- The plan includes greater levels of community involvement
- The plan changes incentives (carrots or sticks)

::: notes

Lots of intriguing ideas from your work in Week 2.

- Don't lose these as they imply strategies for attacking environmental problems in a local community!

## Our Aim for This Week {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Problem-solving in a community requires policy!**
:::

![](Images/03_1-Public-Policy-Research.jpg){.absolute bottom=25 left=100 width="800"}

::: notes

This week we need to **define "policy"** and think carefully about what it means to say that a problem **REQUIRES** a policy solution!

<br>

For today I assigned you a chapter from Michael Munger's *Analyzing Policy* book

- Munger's book is an excellent read for anyone interested in becoming a policy analyst or policymaker.

- Munger makes a series of arguments about policymaking that I want us to unpack together and then evaluate

- We should keep the parts we think will be useful and discard the others

<br>

**Let's set the table first in a big picture way. When you hear the word "policy," what immediately springs to mind?**

- **What are the "policy" examples that you've encountered?**

<br>

- (Laws and regulations by government)

- (Rules for behavior as a student at Drury)

- (Rules tied to your contract with your employer at work)

- (The class syllabus!)

<br>

**SLIDE**: "Requires" is a strong claim here, so let's discuss it.

:::



## {background-image="Images/02-1-cavemen.jpg" .center}

::: notes

Let's start with Munger's discussion of the hypothetical Hun-gats tribe (p40-47)

- This is absolutely one of my favorite thought experiments

<br>

**Talk to me about the tribe. What details stood out for you in this thought experiment?**

<br>

- **What dilemma was the tribe facing?**

- **What options were available to them and what were the pros and cons of each?**

- **Are you convinced there is no reasonable individual path to survival for the Hungats? Why or why not?**

<br>

A tribe of hunter-gatherers in pre-history that are running out of food (or at least the food they know is safe to eat)

- Option: They can stay independent and "free" (every man for himself), but that will almost certainly wipe them out

- Option: Create policy to share risk and increase chances of survival over time

<br>

**Why is Munger telling us this story?**

- **What does he hope aspiring policy analysts will learn from this?**

- (**SLIDE**: *These bullets on next slide*)
    1. There was never a "state of nature"
    2. Survival makes policy a necessity
    3. Battles over expertise are unavoidable
    4. Policy effectiveness depends on authority

**The Lessons of the Hun-gats**

1. There was never a "state of nature"

2. Survival makes policy a necessity

3. Battles over expertise are unavoidable

4. Policy effectiveness depends on authority

:::
::::

::: notes

**REVEAL 1**: The "state of nature" baseline is probably a stupid one as it never could have existed (not even in this thought experiment)

<br>

Think back to our simulation on the first day of class.

- Most of you were strangers to each other when we played the game and yet your behavior was HEAVILY influenced by:

    - Your individual expectations for how you will do in this class (e.g. is EC valuable or not?),

    - Your individual needs for progress towards your longer-term goals (graduation, grad school, etc)

    - Your desire to be seen by the rest of the group in a particular way (classmates and professor)

    - Your sense of how classrooms in college are supposed to function (e.g. what are the rules of behavior?)

    - Your desire (maybe?) to not exterminate a species

    - and so much more...

<br>

There is no "starting from scratch" anywhere in human societies!

- All new policies are built on top of a mess of established policies and there's no avoiding that

<br>

**REVEAL 2**: Survival odds are maximized by sharing risks and benefits in a community

- Socialism for the win, eh?

- Community's require rules to function

<br>

**REVEAL 3**: Battles over expertise are central to policy-making

- There is no single, perfect standard for evaluating outcomes

- Different perspectives and interests will prefer different standards

<br>

**REVEAL 4**: Policy can only ever be as effective as the authority that compels the behavior, e.g. the birth of religious rules?

<br>

**Is everybody clear on these four "lessons"?**

## Our Aim for This Week {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Problem-solving in a community requires policy!**
:::

![](Images/03_1-Public-Policy-Research.jpg){.absolute bottom=25 left=100 width="800"}

::: notes

Back to the big argument!

- *Key discussion number 1, encourage this debate*

<br>

**Are you persuaded that problem-solving in a community requires policy? Why or why not?**

- **In other words, could you imagine a functional society that operated in the absence of policy? Why or why not?**
    
<br>
    
**Are there elements of Munger's thought experiment you think are problematic for supporting this argument? Why or why not?**

<br>

Bottom line, I really appreciate how Munger's thought experiment distills down to the fundamental basics of how any human society functions.

- The creation of policy helps maximize the odds of survival

<br>

**SLIDE**: That takes us to the second policymaking argument we need to evaluate

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

### Problem-solving in a community requires policy, but policymaking has pre-requisites!


![](Images/02-1-Munger_Fig2-3.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Just because you now accept that a problem is serious and needs policy to address it, doesn't mean the community is on board!

- In Figure 2.3 Munger lays out his "three stages of policy choice"

- aka "Deciding How to Decide"

<br>

In essence, Munger's three steps are:

1. Convince the community that there is a problem,

2. Convince the community that it should be addressed collectively, and

3. Convince the community of how the specific policy should be adopted

<br>

Fundamentally, this figure is a reminder for ALL policymakers: **BEFORE you try to solve ANY problem, you MUST make a number of convincing arguments**

<br>

**SLIDE**: For our purposes, I'm going to boil these down to two distinct steps I'm describing as the pre-requisites of policy

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Policymaking Pre-Requisites**

<br>

You must convince the community that:

1. We have a public problem, and

2. We require a collective decision to solve it
:::

::: notes

Each pre-requisite is a distinct argument that you have to successfully make before moving to any actual policy-design

<br>

In other words, before we can debate rules, new taxes, subsidies or anything else you first must succeed in convincing the community that collective action is needed.

- This is NOT an easy step, but the better you do this the easier the rest of the process becomes.

<br>

Let's start with the first of these

- **SLIDE**: What does it mean to argue that we have a public problem?

:::



## Policymaking Pre-Requisite 1 {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Private Problem**

- "My choice has no consequence for your welfare"

**Public Problem**

- "My choices affect your welfare"

:::

::: notes

First you must establish who is being impacted by the choices that are creating the problem, as you see it

- Note that for clarity I am referring to these as debates about the "problem" instead of "decisions" as Munger does in the chapter

<br>

**Give me an example of something in your life that is clearly a "private problem" by this definition.**

<br>

**Now give me an example of something in your life that is clearly a "public problem" by this definition.**

<br>

**How distinct are these two things?**

- **Is it likely the case that people easily agree the difference between public and private problems?**

<br>

- **Give me an example of a problem that straddles the line between public and private these days**

<br>

Ok, so you've convinced the community that we have a public problem, now what?

- **SLIDE**: Now we make the argument that this problem requires a collective decision to solve it
:::


## Policymaking Pre-Requisite 2 {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Individual Decision**

- "I can choose, alone and without interference"

**Collective Decision**

- "Choices are made by a group, and are binding on all"
:::

::: notes
The second pre-requisite is that you convince the community that this problematic "choice" should be governed by rules set by us all collectively.

<br>

**Give me an example of something in your life that should definitely remain an "individual decision" by this definition.**

<br>

**Now give me an example of something in your life that should absolutely require a "collective decision" by this definition.**

<br>

**How distinct are these two things?**

- **Is it likely the case that people easily agree the difference between individual and collective decision problems?**

<br>

- **Give me an example of a problem that straddles the line**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Set up the practice exercise

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Policymaking Pre-Requisites**

<br>

You must convince the community that:

1. We have a public problem, and

2. We require a collective decision to solve it
:::

::: notes

**Ok, any questions on the two pre-requisites we must complete?**

<br>

Let's practice making these kinds of arguments

- *Split class into three groups*

- Go sit with your group and claim some space on the board!

<br>

**SLIDE**: We're going back to the magical fishery!

:::


## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png"}

![](Images/01_1-cartoon_lake.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Does our magical fishery require public policy?**
:::

- Group 1: Private Problem, Individual Decision

- Group 2: Public Problem, Individual Decision

- Group 3: Public Problem, Collective Decision

::: notes

Each group will have ten minutes to put on the board the strongest argument they can that supports one of three possible answers to this question

- Group 1, your conclusion is that the magical fishery is a private problem that should be left to the individual to manage

- Group 2, your conclusion is that the magical fishery is a public problem, BUT it should still be left to the individual to manage

- Group 3, your conclusion is that the magical fishery is a public problem, AND it should be managed collectively

<br>

**Everybody clear on the job?**

- Go!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

- **What advice can we offer each group to help them strengthen their argument?**

<br>

Ok, groups, now you know the enemy!

- Take some time to reinforce your argument AND to prepare a counter-argument against the other two groups

- **Does everybody understand what I'm asking for?**

- Go!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

**Out of curiosity, and in terms of our fishery, which of these do you find the most convincing? Why?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Persuason as setting the foundation for policymaking

**Moving Group 1 to Group 2**

:::

- Group 1: The magical fishery is a private problem that should be left to the individual to manage

- Group 2: The magical fishery is a public problem, BUT it should still be left to the individual to manage

::: notes

Now that we've mapped out the obstacles, our job is to work to overcome them!

<br>

Typically, your first job is to develop consensus in the community around the idea that we have a public problem (not private).

- This means not yet challenging the belief that this is none of your business!

<br>

**Ok, let's brainstorm from strategies for moving someone from Group 1 to Group 2**

- *DISCUSS*

<br>

**Does everybody understand why we start with Group 1 and not Group 2?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Now the usually much harder job!

You must convince the community that:

1. We have a public problem, and

2. We require a collective decision to solve it
:::

::: notes

Alright, now we need to evaluate this second big argument.

<br>

**Are you convinced that these are the required pre-requisites for policymaking in a community? Why or why not?**

- **What is the value in mapping out the positions like this before starting policymaking?**

<br>

- **And what is the value in spending time and effort moving the groups BEFORE beginning policymaking?**

<br>

Bottom line, I am convinced that this pre-requisite stage represents incredibly important time spent laying the foundation for future success in a community: 

- Find the stakeholders, learn about their framings, identify obstacles and work to smooth them!

Munger opens the chapter with three of what he describes as "wisdoms" or ways of people might evaluate the "correctness" of a policy

- The third argument for us to evaluate today is whether or not these wisdoms are a useful tool for policymakers

- Let's step through each in broad terms

::: notes

**What would it mean to adopt the markets as your primary "wisdom" for policymaking?**

- **In other words, how might a markets-focus be used to solve environmental problems?**

<br>

Preference for allocating resources AND solving problems using systems of private exchange. 

- Concerned primarily with process, less so with outcomes

- Preference for non-interventionist style policies wherever possible

- Rules only to keep that market well functioning (contract enforcement, etc)

<br>

**What would a market-based solution to our magical fishery resource look like?**

- **How many fishers? Who fishes? What about enforcement?**

<br>

**According to the chapter, what are the pros and cons of prioritizing a markets focus over the others?**

Pros: 

- Most efficient by definition (most bang for the resource buck)

<br>

Cons - Market failures such as:

1) Monopolies (e.g. antitrust), 

2) Externalities (e.g. pollution), 

3) Under supply of public goods (e.g. free-riding), and 

4) Information problems (e.g. drug safety); Reduces all problems to maximization of use issues
