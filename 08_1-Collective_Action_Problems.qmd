Prep for Class

1. Prep Google form for tracking collective action game
    - https://forms.gle/CT3cTUobfv5ja2xG6
    
2. Prep email with link for the class

3. MAKE SURE when introducing the game to make clear that they get the shared points EVEN if they take some for themselves. SP24 many in the class were surprised after the game that they could have taken and gotten both.

<br>

Last week we began exploring some of the more common complications that arise when dealing with environmental problems.
:::


## Assignment 5: Proposing a Policy {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

Propose a policy to address your selected environmental problem that balances the interests of the relevant stakeholders against the constraints of established institutions and uncertainty.

::: notes
I want to keep this at front of mind for you.

- Your final assignment in this capstone class is to tie together all of your work this semester into a policy proposal meant to address your chosen environmental problem.

<br>

**SLIDE**: A strong policy proposal...
:::


## A convincing policy proposal: {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

- Advances your policy recommendation in **EVERY** paragraph,

- Includes a clear and compelling problem definition,

- Identifies and appeals to specific stakeholders,

- Considers the complications, and

- Offers guidance for measuring its effectiveness over time.

::: notes
**Questions on the final project?**
:::


## Complicating Factors to Consider When Designing Your Policy {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

- Risk aversion (acceptance)

- Temporal discounting and uncertainty

- Collective action problems and free-riding

- Inequality

- Greenwashing

::: notes
This final section of our class is our chance to dig into some of the complications you as policy designers need to be aware of when trying to solve environmental problems.
:::



## Risk Aversion {background-image="Images/13_1-risk-assessment.jpg"}

::: notes
**What does it mean to say that risk aversion can complicate environmental problem-solving?**

<br>

**Give me a real-world example**

<br>

**What policy design advice can we offer to someone trying to solve an environmental problem with significant levels of risk aversion or acceptance?**

- **Does one of our policy options handle this better than the others?**
:::


## Temporal Discounting {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align='center'}

::: notes
**What does it mean to say that differences in stakeholders levels of temporal discounting can complicate environmental problem-solving?**

<br>

**Give me a real-world example**

<br>

**What policy design advice can we offer to someone trying to solve an environmental problem where different stakeholders hold very different discount rates?**

- **Does one of our policy options handle this better than the others?**

## Let's play a quick game! {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center} 

::: notes
The game is very simple

- I will offer you some bonus points for your final paper and you will decide how many to take.

- I will give you two choices and you must select **ONLY** one of them
:::



## Let's play a quick game! {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center} 

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
Option 1

- Contribute 1/2 a bonus point to the class
:::

::: notes

This option allows you to give every person in class 1/2 a bonus point

- If everyone in a class of 20 chooses this, everyone gets +10 on their final paper

<br>

Please note, I only keep whole numbers and I round down in this game

- So, your 1/2 point contribution is worth ZERO points unless someone else makes the same choice
    
<br>

**Any questions on option 1?**
:::


## Let's play a quick game! {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center} 

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
Option 1

- Contribute 1/2 a bonus point to the class

Option 2: 

- Take the class bonus points PLUS 5 extra
:::

::: notes
This option lets you enjoy everything contributed by those taking Option 1 PLUS I give YOU an additional 5 points

<br>

Let's imagine a class of 20 that splits 10 and 10

- The 10 people choosing Option 1 contribute 5 bonus points to EVERYONE in class regardless of the option they chose

- The 10 people choosing Option 2 get the 5 bonus points from Option 1 PLUS 5 more for choosing Option 2 = 10!

<br>

**Any questions on option 2?**

<br>

Two notes:

1. Your choice MUST be made secretly

    - No one is allowed to see your choice
    
    - If you break this rule you get nothing.
    
2. Your choice will remain secret

    - Only you and I will ever know the choice you made
    
    - It is entirely up to you after the game to reveal your choice if you want to

<br>

*Send link to Google Form*

- I have just emailed everyone a Google Form to collect your choices

- On the form you have to give your name (so I can record the points) and make your choice.

- No talking from this point on!

- Go!

<br>

**Before I reveal the results, any guesses as to the outcome?**

- **What are you basing your guesses on?**

## Collective Action Problems {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center} 

<br>

"A collective action problem or social dilemma is a situation in which all individuals would be better off cooperating but fail to do so because of conflicting interests between individuals that discourage joint action" (Wikipedia 2021).

::: notes
Let's start with the first sentence from the Wikipedia entry!

<br>

**How did our bonus point game illustrate a collective action problem?**

<br>

Often we introduce collective action problems using a Prisoner's Dilemma. 

- **Has anybody ever heard of the Prisoner's Dilemma?**

- (**SLIDE**)

## {background-image="Images/07-1-bank_robbery.jpg"} 

::: notes
You can tell the story many different ways, but here's a quick version.

<br>

Two thieves rob a bank and decide to split up in order to make their getaway

- The plan is meet up later and divvy up the loot.

<br>

The cops catch each of them separately and bring them "downtown" for questioning.

<br>

Both still had their guns with them when captured so are in some trouble / look pretty darn suspicious.

- e.g. gun possession is good for a couple years in jail
:::



## {background-image="Images/07-1-interrogation.png"} 

::: notes

Now we introduce the dilemma facing our robbers

- The robbers are placed in separate interrogation rooms.

- Each is made an offer at the same time.

<br>

**The Offer**: The first one to confess to the robbery and agree to testify against the other person goes COMPLETELY free.

<br>

Put yourself in the shoes of one of the robbers.

- As a first pass, we can think of this as a simple decision for you.

- **SLIDE**
:::



## Your Decision {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

<br>

+ Confess quickly and go free

OR

+ Stay silent and go to jail
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Images/07-1-cartoon_thief.webp')
```
:::
::::

::: notes

*Read options on screen*

<br>

In a world where only you matter, the decision is pretty easy to think through as a cost-benefit analysis.

- Going free is pretty universally preferred to going to jail.

<br>

However, the outcome of this dilemma depends on both the choice YOU make AND the choice made by the other suspect.
:::



## {background-image="Images/12-1-Eric-Garland-Game-Theory.jpg" background-size='95%'} 

::: notes

That means, it's time for some game theory!

- Game Theory is a theoretical approach to analyzing decision-making born from micro-economics.

<br>

Game theory primarily focuses on individuals (or groups who make decisions collectively)

- It is typically applied to competitive situations wherein outcomes are determined by the actions of all the players

- And ultimately it is meant to help us evaluate strategies for navigating these scenarios.

<br>

#### Old notes
- Game theory is "the branch of mathematics concerned with the analysis of strategies for dealing with competitive situations where the outcome of a participant's choice of action depends critically on the actions of other participants" (Oxford Languages).

::: notes

In game theoretic terms this is what we call a non-cooperative game in normal form.

- The four boxes represent the four possible outcomes of the game

- We get to a single box once we know the decision of each player.

<br>

*Go through a couple to make sure it's clear*

<br>

**So, in this position what would you do and why?**

- *Force discussion of each option*

<br>

- (Is the other suspect your best friend or just some guy?)

- (How much evidence do the cops already have?)

- (Do you already have a record?)

<br>

**So, what do we think is the most likely outcome for these two prisoners?**

- (Everybody's going to jail!)

::: notes

Game theory is designed to help us analyze social dilemmas like this.

<br>

Game Theory Principle 1: We expect the players in this game to pick their dominant strategy (if one exists)

- We define a "dominant strategy" as one that wins for you REGARDLESS of what the other player does.

<br>

Game Theory Principle 2: We expect the players to reach an outcome that is Pareto optimal.

- Pareto optimality means no one can improve their final position without making the other person worse off.

<br>

A good place to start when analyzing these games is to find the Nash Equilibrium

- Approach named for the mathematician John Nash.

<br>

To find the NE imagine what you would do if you had perfect information.

- e.g. You know what the other robber is going to do before he does it!

Let's focus the outcomes on just you alone for a moment

- This helps us see that you face four possible outcomes

Now, remember I just told you that finding the NE means pretending you have perfect information.

Seems pretty easy to say that given a choice between jail and freedom a rational actor will choose freedom.

Given the choice, I suspect most people choose 6 over 10 years of jail time.

<br>

**So, what does this mean for you in playing the game?**

- **What do we learn from imagining we had perfect information?**

<br>

This shows us that there IS a dominant strategy in this game.

- Regardless of what the other player chooses you reach your preferred outcome by confessing.

<br>

The dominant strategy in game theory refers to a situation where one player has a superior tactic regardless of how the other players act. 

- In this game, no matter what the other person does, your better outcome comes from confessing.

<br>

**Does this make sense?**

"a stable state of a system involving the interaction of different participants, in which no participant can gain by a unilateral change of strategy if the strategies of the others remain unchanged" (Oxford Languages).
:::

::: notes
The logic is mirrored for both subjects

- With perfect information the second robber should always prefer confessing to staying silent

<br>

It turns out that confess, confess is the Nash Equilibrium

- For both players, confessing is the dominant strategy and that leads to a single outcome

<br>

**REVEAL** definition

<br>

In this version of the game, no player can make themselves better off by changing their own decision if the other player's decision is fixed

- If you know they are going to stay silent, you should confess and changing that will NOT make you better off

- **Make sense?**

## Collective Action Problems {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

"A collective action problem or social dilemma is a situation in which all individuals would be better off cooperating but fail to do so because of conflicting interests between individuals that discourage joint action" (Wikipedia 2021).

::: notes
Back to our definition of a collective action problem!

<br>

The PD is one version of a class of games we refer to as collective action problems

- **Does everybody now have a better sense of what this definition is talking about?**

<br>

In short, collective action problems arise when individuals want to cooperate but can't seem to get there because of the complexities of the world.

- Our readings for today illustrate two ways the world conspires to make cooperation harder.

For today I had you read a short excerpt from Garret Hardin’s "Tragedy of the Commons."

### Anybody ever read this before?

<br>

First and foremost let me tell you, I AGONIZED over whether or not to assign any piece of this reading to you.

- On the plus side this is one of, if not THE, most cited and assigned research articles studying policy and the environment.

- Nearly 50,000 citations.

Hardin's environmental concerns were driven almost entirely by his racism and disdain for the poor.

<br>

I assigned you only the portion relevant to our work, that which describes the pasture thought experiment.

- The rest of the article is scary, but we'll deal with that on Thursday as we explore how inequality complicates environmental problem-solving.

## The Commons {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

The Commons: "...the natural resources and vital life-support services that belong to all humankind rather than to any one country" (Chasek, Downie and Brown 2014).

- Think oceans, seabed minerals, Antarctica and the atmosphere.

- None exist within the borders of any sovereign state.

<br>

Think of this like an Ostrom-style Common Pool Resource that has no owner or exists outside the sovereignty of any individual state to control

- **Any questions on the baseline concept?**

## {background-image="Images/07-1-empty_pasture.jpg" .center}

::: notes
**What did you submit to Canvas as your analysis of the biggest environmental obstacle identified by the Hardin piece?**

<br>

The tragedy of the commons is typically explained using a story about a pasture.

### Who owns this pasture?

- (No one?)
- (Everyone?)
- (Both?)

<br>

### Does it make sense that if no one owns the pasture, everyone owns it?

### - Does that equivalency make sense?
:::



## {background-image="Images/07-1-pasture.jpg" .center}

::: notes
For the sake of this discussion, all of you are ranchers who own herds of cattle.

- On this commons you all choose to graze your cattle.

<br>

**Why would you choose to graze your cattle on the commons pasture and not your own land?**

- (maximize benefits by not having to pay to feed them!)

<br>

So, let's go back to the problematic equivalency from a moment ago.

- **Who actually pays to feed your cattle when they feed on the commons?**

<br>

- (Everyone pays PLUS the environment pays and the public pays)

- Add a cow to gain 1 but you also have to pay 1.

<br>

**In this instance, should you add a cow to your herd?**

- (Probably not in this case)

- (Maybe if as your scale increases the costs of adding each additional cow falls?)

<br>

Now, what happens to the CBA when we add a cow to the commons?

- **How does using the commons to feed your new cow alter your CBA?**

**To the Commons**

+ Benefits = +1

+ Costs = -1/x
:::
::::

::: notes
**First, why doesn't using the commons change the benefits?**

- (Still your cow!)

<br>

The key difference is in the costs

- X is the population size

- This says that the costs of feeding your cow is shared amongst everyone

- The commons loses 1, but that cost is divided amongst the owners of the commons e.g. everybody.

<br>

**Does that make sense?**

<br>

Important distinction here: Society pays MOST of the costs of feeding your cattle.

- That means we each pay part of the cost.

<br>

**So, if you are the only person using the commons, should you add a cow?**

- (Takes us back to the previous +1 + -1 = 0.)

<br>

**What happens to the costs you face as the population around you gets bigger?**

- (Your share of the cost shrinks to almost nothing)

- The more of us there are, the smaller your individual share.

<br>

### So, what is the bottom line here? When should you add a cow to your herd?

- (1. When there is a commons to feed it, and)

- (2. When there are a lot of other people also using it.)

<br>

### And what does all of this mean for the survival of the commons?

And why is that?

## Why is the commons doomed? {background-image="Images/13_1-Destroyed_Field_v2.png" .center}

<br>

1) The benefits are real and immediate

<br>

2) The costs are small and shared

<br>

3) Even if you do the "right" thing, someone else will add another cow and the commons will collapse

::: notes

*Read criteria*

<br>

In essence, Hardin is arguing the Commons is a PD game and your dominant strategy is to defect every round!

- This is essentially a justification for environmental exploitation

- You may as well do it before someone else destroys the environment

<br>

**Can everybody now see why Ostrom, and many others, reacted so poorly to this argument?**

- Hard to accept humanity is compelled to commit suicide

- Not much empirical evidence of this actually happening over and over again.

- As we noted in the PD game, other factors matter too for whether we decide to defect or not!

<br>

Clearly, the Hardin argument is limited, however, there is something important we should take from it.

This represents the first kind of collective action problem that makes environmental problem solving complicated.

So, here's the game you played against each other person in the class.

<br>

**Does this game have a dominant strategy? why or why not?**

- **If you had perfect information, what would you do?**

- ("Take"!)

<br>

**So, does this mean everyone in class should have "taken" rather than "contributed"? Why or why not?**

- (Built on a huge assumption: This dominant strategy assumes only one other player!)

<br>
    
**How does this table change if you updated it to reflect playing with 19 other people?**

::: notes

The dominant strategy for a single person thinking only of themselves is to "take."

- If the class contributes then you "take" 14 points instead of 10

- If the class takes then you "take" 5 instead of zero

<br>

But what about the class acting together?

- **Is their dominant strategy to "take"?**

<br>

No! It's to contribute!

- If the individual contributes then you "contribute" to get 10 points instead of 5

- If the individual takes then you "contribute" to get 9 instead of five!

<br>

**So, what is the lesson from this?**

- Individuals who feel disconnected from the community more likely to defect!

- Big gains from acting together

<br>

The key for us as policy designers, and what Olson wants to help you understand, is that we CAN overcome free-riding with good policy design!

::: notes

Mancur Olson identifies that flipping the costs and benefits ALSO leads to a serious problem: Free-riders.

- In Hardin's story, individuals make good choices for themselves which combine to make bad choices for society.

- In Olson's story, he shows us that it is REALLY hard to get individuals to pay tiny costs in exchange for big benefits for the wider society.

- In a system where you benefit from collective action whether you help or not, your individual incentives will push you to not help

<br>

Think, climate change!

- (Smaller groups advantaged for stopping free-riding)
    - Easier to monitor, more social pressure to comply
    
- (Large groups need institutional designs to increase compliance)
    - Membership benefits for paying dues (access to a park, magazine, bumper stickers)
