Prep for Class

1. Record Canvas submissions

2. Be ready to show them the fusion panel slides

<br>

**SLIDE**: Before we dig into Drury, we need to design tomorrow's Fusion Day capstone!

:::



## Fusion Day (Apr 23) Capstone Panel {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center .smaller}

- 20 minute presentation

- What are the courses in the certificate? (me: 3 mins)

- Introduce capstone topic (me: 1 minute)
    - Why is food waste important in SGF? (Student 1: 2 mins)
    - Why is it a public problem? (Student 2: 2 mins)
    - Why do we need a collective decision? (Student 3: 2 mins)
    - Policy examples to address the problem (1 example per student, 1 min each)

- Q&A (7 mins)


::: notes

Task: We have 20 minutes to present the work of the certificate and answer questions

<br>

Let me show you the basic slides I have made for tomorrow

- *Show them the panel slides*

<br>

*Split class into three groups, one group per volunteer*

- *Decide which student will do which prompt*

<br>

GROUPS, help the volunteer map out what they should cover in their 2 minutes

- Work directly on the board so we can ensure no significant overlap between them

- Go!

<br>

*REPORT back and DISCUSS*

<br>

**What policy examples do we want to briefly highlight?**

- **We need three!**

<br>

**Volunteers, do you feel ready? Any questions or concerns?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's shift our focus back to Drury!

1) **Describe** the problem facing our community

2) **Investigate** the relevant stakeholders

3) **Frame** the problem for the stakeholders

4) **Design** a policy to address the problem

5) Take **action** to push the plan forward!

Ok, let's shift our focus to the food waste problem here on campus

- We've got two weeks to get up to speed and get involved!

<br>

**SLIDE**: At this point I think you have a pretty strong sense of the food waste problem in SGF but now we need to start dialing in our focus even more narrowly

**Describe** the problem facing our community

- Let's brainstorm the food waste CPRs on campus

::::

::: notes

Let's begin by brainstorming the food waste CPRs here on campus

- *ON BOARD*

<br>

- Dorms (no kitchen) -> Food waste (lbs)

- Dorms (with kitchen) -> Food waste (lbs)

- Fraternity/Sorority -> Food waste (lbs)

- Cafeteria (back of house) -> Food waste (lbs)

- Cafeteria (front of house) -> Food waste (lbs)

- CX (back of house) -> Food waste (lbs)

- CX (front of house) -> Food waste (lbs)

- Einstein Bagels (back of house) -> Food waste (lbs)

- Einstein Bagels (front of house) -> Food waste (lbs)

<br>

**Where do you want to focus on this list?**

- **Given our time constraints I suggest we all focus on one.**

<br>

My two cents: I think we should focus on Drury students in different kinds of on-campus housing (apartment, no kitchen, greek life, etc)

- Avoids going back to food services (students have already reached out a lot!)

- Gives us more avenues for info gathering (students can reach out more comfortably to friend groups)

- Might also offer more things we can do in week 15

<br>

**SLIDE**: Next Class

:::



## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
**We need information on how Drury stakeholders:**

- View the problem, 

- Contribute to the problem, and 

- How open they are to changing their behavior

:::

::: notes

Before we end today I'd like us to agree on a set of common questions we plan on using to collect this information.

<br>

**Let's throw out some ideas!**

- *ON BOARD*

<br>

1. Name of stakeholder

2. Student, faculty or staff

3. Year in school / years at Drury

4. Other class Qs...

<br>

Assignment for next class: I want each of you to collect data from AT LEAST five Drury students, faculty or staff (target depends on our CPR focus).

<br>

**Questions on the assignment?**
