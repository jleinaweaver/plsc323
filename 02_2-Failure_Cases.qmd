Prep for Class

1. Review Canvas submissions

<br>

Today we continue our work from last class analyzing case studies of local communities attempting to solve environmental problems

<br>

My hopes for this exercise remain twofold:

1. To give you a broader list of specific examples of local communities grappling with environmental problems that you can draw from in our work, and

2. To give you a head start on thinking about policy-making in terms of theory and process

<br>

**SLIDE**: Last class...

<br>

### What are our big picture takeaways from the success cases?

- Are there certain kinds of environmental problem, community or policy approach that is more likely to succeed?

::: notes

**What were your takeaways from our work last class?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Enough success, let's talk about the failures!

## The Failure Cases {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
1. What happened?
    - Failure to act, status quo bias, removing good policy

2. Why are you convinced this was a failure?

::: notes

Let's speed around the room to introduce the cases

- In a moment we'll dig more deeply into all of them, but let's begin with a broad overview

- Be an active listener as we do this!

<br>

*PRESENT each*

<br>

*Split class into NEW (different than last class) small groups (five groups of four)*

- Go sit with your group!

<br>

**1. Characteristics of the Environmental Problems**

- What are the common characteristics for the environmental problems in our failure stories?

::: notes

Groups, take some time to review ALL of the cases submitted on Canvas in order to make this list.

- Focus JUST on the failure cases to begin. We'll compare to the successes in a moment.

- **Questions on the task?**

- Go!

<br>

*ON BOARD: Present and discuss each*

**Class Notes (2025-SP)**

- ?

<br>

Ok, now I want you to compare and contrast the success cases against the failures as we think in terms of new theory

- **What environmental problem characteristics do we suspect lead to success or failure? Why?**

### What are our big picture takeaways from the comparative case study this week?

- What should we keep in mind when trying to solve a local environmental problem?

::: notes

Groups, take a minute to reflect on all our cases and consider if there are any inferences we would like to draw so far

- Any elements of our success cases that you suspect might be tied to the success or failure of environmental problem-solving?

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS*

- *Force this discussion*

## Next Week: Public Policy {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: notes

What is policy? Why do we use it? How has SGF used it?

You have a reading and Canvas assignment due before next class
