Prep for Class

1. Review Canvas submissions

<br>

Today we continue our work from last class analyzing case studies of local communities attempting to solve environmental problems

<br>

My hopes for this exercise remain twofold:

1. To give you a broader list of specific examples of local communities grappling with environmental problems that you can draw from in our work, and

2. To give you a head start on thinking about policy-making in terms of theory and process

<br>

**Theories of Environmental Problem-Solving**
:::

<br>

### We are more likely to solve an environmental problem when...

- The problem looks like X

- The community looks like Y

- The action taken looks like Z


::: notes

Last class we performed a comparative case study exercise looking at cases of successful environmental problem-solving

- We used those cases to propose theories of causation

<br>

**Focusing just on the type of problem, what did we propose as possible theories of success?**

- (**SLIDE**)

**Theories of Environmental Problem-Solving: Problem Type**
:::

<br>

**P(Success) increases when**

- The visibility of the problem increases
- The threat of harm is imminent
- The source of the problem is clear
- The greater the agreement on the cause of the problem

::: notes

One of the BIG values of theory is that it enables us to design strategies of action!

- If these theories represent causal tendencies in the world then they also tell us how to attack an environmental problem

<br>

**If these are our theories of success, then what specific menu of strategies should we consider when trying to solve a problem in a community?**

Environmental Problem Characteristics

1. More visible the problem
2. The more everyone defines the problem in the same way
3. The more imminent the threat
4. The clearer the source of the problem

**Theories of Environmental Problem-Solving: Community Type**

<br>

**P(Success) increases when**

- The size of the impacted community is smaller
- The community has a greater sense of shared values
- The community has a demonstrated pattern of activism
- The community is more affluent

*Class notes 2025-01-21*

Community Characteristics

1. Size (smaller more likely to act?)
2. Shared values
3. Demonstrated energy or activism / community
4. Affluence of the affected

**Theories of Environmental Problem-Solving: Action Type**
:::

<br>

**P(Success) increases when**

- The money available to act is greater
- The plan includes criteria for measuring effectiveness
- The plan includes greater levels of community involvment
- The plan changes incentives (carrots or sticks)

Today we check our developing theories against failure cases

- **SLIDE**: We have to avoid selecting on the dependent variable

<br>

*Class notes 2025-01-21*

Policy Characteristics

1. Financial backing
2. Plan has criteria for measuring effectiveness / tracking progress
3. High levels of community involvement
4. Focus on changing incentives (carrots or sticks)

## Selecting on the Dependent Variable {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png"}

::: notes

Selection bias is a serious problem in science

- It happens when the sample of data you are analyzing is biased 

- e.g. it systematically excludes some set of cases you need

<br>

Commonly this takes the form of selecting on the dependent variable

- I'm guessing the authors of these pieces want you to think all you need to do is tweak your parenting or your breakfast routine and you too will be successful!

- But without checking to see if unsuccessful people also eat chia seeds, you can't really know anything about how the world actually works

<br>

**Make sense**?

<br>

So, we want to use our failure cases today to BOTH:

- Generate correlations between characteristics and failure, AND

- To check and see if our intuitions from last class hold up!

:::




## The Failure Cases {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
1. What was the specific "environmental" problem?

2. What was the specific action taken and by whom?

3. Why are you convinced this was a success?

::: notes

Let's speed around the room to introduce the cases

- In a moment we'll dig more deeply into all of them, but let's begin with a broad overview

- Be an active listener as we do this!

<br>

*PRESENT each*

<br>

*Split class into NEW (different than last class) small groups (five groups of four)*

- Go sit with your group!

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

**What are the common characteristics for the environmental problems in our failure stories?**

<br>

**Success theories to re-evaluate: P(Success) increases when**

- The visibility of the problem increases
- The threat of harm is imminent
- The source of the problem is clear
- The greater the agreement on the cause of the problem

::: notes

Groups, take some time to review ALL of the cases submitted on Canvas in order to make do TWO jobs

1. List the common characteristics from the failure cases, and 

2. Check and see if our intuitions from last class hold up!

<br>

**Questions on the task?**

- Go!

<br>

*ON BOARD: Present and discuss each*

## Thinking Theoretically {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

### What are our big picture takeaways from the comparative case study this week?

- What should we keep in mind when trying to solve a local environmental problem?

::: notes

Groups, take a minute to reflect on all our cases and consider if there are any inferences we would like to draw so far

- Any elements of our success cases that you suspect might be tied to the success or failure of environmental problem-solving?

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS*

- *Force this discussion*

<br>

**SLIDE**: For next week

::: notes

What is policy? Why do we use it? How has SGF used it?

You have a reading and Canvas assignment due before next class
