Prep for Class

1. Review Canvas submissions

2. Bring markers x 2

<br>

**SLIDE**: The process

**Engaging Productively as Problem-Solvers**

1) **Describe** the problem facing our community

2) **Investigate** the relevant stakeholders

3) **Frame** the problem

4) **Design** a policy to address the problem

5) Take **action** to push the plan forward!

::::

::: notes

This week we continue our work in step 1 of this process.

- What I hope you are seeing is that all this work to describe and conceptualize the problem is opening up our avenues into the other steps

<br>

The more ways we find to describe the problem or the deeper we come to understand it:

- The more stakeholders we identify as important resources,

- The more institutions we identify as obstacles or opportunities for change, and

- The more ideas we will encounter that have been proposed to address our problem

<br>

::: notes

I thought this was an EXCELLENT trip!

<br>

**What were your big takeaways?**

- **New stakeholders identified?**

- **Aspects of the problem we hadn't considered?**

- **Existing institutions or infrastructure to be aware of?**

- **Curent projects we could help with?**

- **Current needs identified?**

<br>

*ON BOARD*

<br>

Alright, last week before our trip we gathered and evaluated evidence meant to help us better understand the health impacts of our chosen problem

- **SLIDE**: Let's recap those

Therefore, food waste negatively impacts human health

**What were the strongest premises we developed in this argument? Why?**

<br>

**Overall, is this a convincing argument? Why or why not?**

- **Anything big we agreed was missing?**

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png"  .center}

**Describing the Problem - Economics**

- Submit evidence we can use to deepen our understanding of **EITHER the economic causes or consequences** of our food waste problem.

- Please don't submit something that has already been submitted.

::: notes

**Everybody ready to go on our assignment for today?**

<br>

*Split class into two groups by what they submitted: 1) Economic causes and 2) Economic consequences*

- Go sit with your groups and claim space on the board

<br>

**SLIDE**: The prompt

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

**Describing the Problem - Economics**

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Exploring the Evidence as Separate Arguments**

- Therefore, there are significant economic factors creating food waste

- Therefore, there are serious economic consequences of food waste

:::

::: notes

We'll approach our work today in the same manner we did last class

The first step I want you to do on your own.

- Everybody take out a piece of paper and something to write with

<br>

**SLIDE**: Step 1

:::



## Describing the Problem: Step 1 {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

### Summarize your assignment submission as a premise in this argument

- e.g. Food waste is a problem caused by...

- e.g. Food waste creates serious economic costs such as...

::: notes

Working on your own I want you to take a few minutes to reflect on your assignment submission and then convert it into a premise in your group's argument

- Your premise should be a complete sentence that adopts this structure

- Write the premise on the first line of the paper

<br>

Ok, below the premise I want you to describe the evidence you have brought to support this premise

- Again, complete sentences!

<br>

Ok, next I need you to evaluate the quality of the evidence given your premise

- Is this evidence high enough quality to convincingly establish the likelihood that your premise is correct? Why or why not?

- Complete sentences!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Back to the group

**The Arguments**

- Therefore, there are significant economic factors creating food waste

- Therefore, there are serious economic consequences of food waste

<br>

**The Argument Diagrams**

1. Consolidate (and order) the premises, and

2. Specify the evidence underpinning each

:::

::: notes

Ok groups, review all the work that has been written down and work to develop your argument on the board

- You'll likely have premises that overlap so combine them!

- You should order them from strongest premises to weakest

    - This is not a critique of what anyone submitted, but about building our most convincing argument!
    
- Under each premise you should specify the supporting evidence

<br>

**Questions on this step?**

- Go!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

- Present your argument to the other group making clear where evidence is lacking or uncertainty is high

<br>

**What specific parts of these arguments need more or better evidence?**

<br>

**Are there any gaps in either argument we need to fill in?**

- e.g. types of people, species or places likely impacted but not included in our evidence?

<br>

**How applicable are these arguments to our local community?**

- **In other words, are these arguments too generic or general to apply to our backyard?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Apply to report 1

:::

**Outcome 1: Baseline Argument Report**
:::

<br>

Make a three premise argument that we have an environmental problem to address in our community:

- Premise 1 - This is an important problem

- Premise 2 - This is a public problem

- Premise 3 - The problem should be addressed collectively

::: notes

Apply to Report 1, Premise 1: Which premises from these arguments do you think would BEST help you make the importance argument?

Apply to Report 1, Premise 2: Which premises from these arguments do you think would BEST help you make the argument that food waste is a public problem?

Apply to Report 1, Premise 3: Which premises from these arguments do you think would BEST help you make the argument that addressing the food waste public problem SHOULD BE a collective decision?

<br>

1. **Is each of these a logical argument? e.g. do the premises support the conclusion?**
