<p><strong>My Notes: Cronon’s Argument</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, wilderness is a human creation and our mythologizing about it makes it harder to solve environmental problems.</p>
<p>Therefore, our current understanding of the wilderness is at the root of many of our serious environmental problems.</p>
<p>Therefore, wilderness is a human creation and it cannot solve the problem of “our culture’s problematic relationships with the nonhuman world” (p8)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Up to the 18th century “wilderness” meant deserted, savage, desolate, barren, and a waste (8).
<ul>
<li>Biblical references to the wilderness as a place of “moral confusion and despair” (8)</li>
<li>“Wilderness, in short, was a place to which one came only against one’s will, and always in fear and trembling. Whatever value it might have arose solely from the possibility that it might be”reclaimed” and turned toward human ends…” (9).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>19th c forward, the wilderness is a temple of restoration
<ul>
<li>By the end of the 19th century the meaning of wilderness has been transformed</li>
<li>Thoreau in 1862 could declare wildness to be the preservation of the world</li>
<li>John Muir arrived in the Sierra Nevada in 1869, he would declare, “No description of Heaven that I have ever heard or read of seems half so fine.”</li>
<li>US begins creating national parks with Yellowstone in 1872</li>
<li>The seemingly unprecedented battle over the dam that flooded the Hetch Hetchy valley (1908-1913)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wilderness Transforms 1: Domestication of the Sublime (10-13)
<ul>
<li>Wilderness once connected to the “awesome power of the sublime”; Wordsworth describing his climbing the Alps as one of terror when brought face-to-face with the divine. A sense of awe/dismay, not joy/pleasure.</li>
<li>By the second half of the 19th century tourism into the wilderness had begun to domesticate the sublime; transform it into a “sacred temple” that offered restoration not fear.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Explaining the transformation 2: The end of the Frontier
<ul>
<li>Belief in the frontier as source of national renewal; To be an American meant to be connected to the land, to a more primitive existence that inspired vigor, individualism and democracy (13).</li>
<li>By the 1890s the argument was that the frontier was being lost and that meant wilderness needed to be preserved.</li>
<li>Perception by many elites that civilization was sapping men of their rugged manliness, feminizing them and that they needed wilderness experiences to compensate.</li>
<li>The quasi-religious aspects of modern environmentalism are very problematic (15-)</li>
<li>Wilderness as revitalizing frontier deeply ironic.</li>
<li>Wilderness as a toy of the well-to-do, projecting their fantasies onto the landscape (15)</li>
<li>“Virgin” wilderness ignores native populations that called it home; removing them to make it uninhabited shows just how artificial this construct is.</li>
<li>Making the wilderness safe for tourists does not reflect actual violence of the frontier</li>
<li>“Only people whose relation to the land was already alienated could hold up wilderness as a model for human life in nature, for the romantic ideology of wilderness leaves precisely nowhere for human beings actually to make their living from the land” (17).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wilderness that places humanity outside of nature poses a serious threat to responsible environmentalism
<ul>
<li>The central paradox is that wilderness places humanity outside of nature which poses a serious threat to responsible environmentalism at the end of the twentieth century (17).</li>
<li>If protecting wilderness is the metric for a good society then we deny ourselves “hope of discovering what an ethical, sustainable, honorable human place in nature might actually look like.”</li>
<li>By pretending our “real home” is in the wilderness, we allow ourselves to ignore and avoid dealing with the problems where we actually live.</li>
<li>“Wilderness” as an untouched and pure thing is too frequently the implicit rationale for pursuing “environmental” ends (see endangered species act example p18).</li>
<li>An absurd paradox: “if nature dies because we enter it, then the only way to save nature is to kill ourselves” (19).</li>
<li>“Idealizing a distant wilderness too often means not idealizing the environment in which we actually live, the landscape that for better or worse we call home. Most of our most serious environmental problems start right here, at home, and if we are to solve those problems, we need an environmental ethic that will tell us as much about using nature as about not using it” (21).</li>
<li>“Indeed, my principal objection to wilderness is that it may teach us to be dismissive or even contemptuous of such humble places and experiences” (22). e.g.&nbsp;the flower or tree in your yard.</li>
<li>We must abandon “the dualism that sees the tree in the garden as artificial -completely fallen and unnatural -and the tree in the wilderness as natural -completely pristine and wild. Both trees in some ultimate sense are wild; both in a practical sense now depend on our management and care” (24).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Setting aside end of essay that makes the case for a healthier approach to nature / wilderness. All important in ethics terms but not for our definitional exercises</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Wilderness is a human creation and, therefore, it cannot solve the problem of “our culture’s problematic relationships with the nonhuman world” (p8)</li>

<p>“A wilderness is an area of land that has been largely undisturbed by modern human development” (National Geographic).</p>

<p>National Geographic defines wilderness much more simply</p>

<p>Wilderness, in common usage, refers to essentially two qualities or characteristics:</p>

<li>“An Avalanche in the Alps”</li>
<li>1740–1812</li>
<li>De Loutherbourg was born in Strasbourg, France and had a successful career in Paris as a landscape painter. In 1771 he moved to London and began also working as a set and costume designer. In this scene, De Loutherbourg combines nature and human drama, to theatrical effect. An avalanche is shown advancing towards three figures and a dog. De Loutherbourg has captured the moment before they are overwhelmed by the powerful natural force.</li>

<strong>2. Recognize the wildness around you, and</strong>
</p>
<p style="color: white;">
<strong>consider the needs of the people living on Earth</strong>
</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Cronon’s First Answer: Recognize that “wilderness” is a social construct</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We must abandon “the dualism that sees the tree in the garden as artificial…and the tree in the wilderness as natural… Both trees in some ultimate sense are wild; <strong>both in a practical sense now depend on our management and care</strong>” (24).</p></li>
<li><p>This means we have responsibilities to resource management both in the artifical “wild places” AND where humans live too!</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Cronon’s Second Answer: Environmental problem-solving must begin at home and must consider the needs of the people (the creatures?) living on the Earth.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>By pretending our “real home” is in the wilderness, we allow ourselves to ignore and avoid dealing with the problems where we actually live.</strong></li>
</ul>

<li><p><em>Force this discussion</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ultimately, this article, and the book it comes from, helped me think very differently about environmental policy and solving problems in a community.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I realized I should not assume that the construct I like (wilderness) is automatically “better than” or “more valuable than” the one you like (industry, jobs, feeding your family).</p></li>
<li><p>I also came to see how humans have managed “the wilderness” in an active way which means I shouldn’t oppose management and use policies simply to keep things to a “pristine” standard that never existed.</p></li>

<p><br></p>
<p><strong>REVEAL</strong>: 1) We must remember that all of the concepts related to environmental problems will be contested (e.g.&nbsp;fought over),</p>
<ul>
<li>No matter how obvious you think the problem is, I assure you that all of the stakeholders view it somewhat differently</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>REVEAL</strong>: 2) Your chosen definition automatically narrows the options of policies you think are acceptable vs not</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definitions set the agenda of future action</p></li>
<li><p>Be strategic when establishing a definition and be flexible in considering alternative viewpoints</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>REVEAL</strong>: 3) Conflicts over problem definitions often drive the most serious disputed regarding environmental problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>The most effective policy solutions begin with clear definitions that generate buy-in from the relevant stakeholders</li>
</ul>

<p>Canvas Assignment: Auditing the “wilderness” in our backyard (10pts)</p>
<p>Spend an hour exploring the Drury campus and surrounding streets thinking critically about the “wilderness” in our backyard. For this exercise I want you to adopt a very broad definition of the environmental concept. This can certainly mean the plants, animals, air and soil, but should also reflect other aspects of our well-being (e.g.&nbsp;transportation, food, safety, etc.).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What are AT LEAST THREE specific aspects of Drury’s “wilderness” that we are managing well?</li>
<li>Are there any specific actions you take as part of your typical routine that contribute to the protection and promotion of wilderness on Drury’s campus? What are they?</li>
<li>What are AT LEAST THREE specific aspects of Drury’s “wilderness” that need to be improved or managed better?</li>
<li>What are AT LEAST TWO specific actions you take as part of your typical routine that contribute to these problems?</li>
