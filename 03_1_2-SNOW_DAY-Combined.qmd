Prep for Class

1. Review Canvas submissions

2. Save the final theories brainstormed by class today in slides for next class (3-2) so we can evaluate them with the success cases

<br>

Snow day slightly complicates our work for this week, but we'll roll with it!

- Its been a while so let's recap our work last week

- **SLIDE**: We ended last week discussing the lessons of Munger's book chapter on public policy

**Problem-solving in a community requires policy**

::: notes

Let's refresh some of the big arguments from our discussions

<br>

**First and foremost, what is "policy"?**

- (**SLIDE**: The Burke quote)

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

![](Images/02-1-Burke_Quote.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

I like the Burke quote just because it puts the focus in the right place

- Government is a human effort to deliver what we want

- Policy is, in essence, rules created by a government or community for managing our needs

<br>

**According to Munger, why is policy a non-optional requirement for all communities?**

- **Why can't we just leave each other alone?**

- (**SLIDE**: The Hun-gats thought experiment)

:::




## {background-image="Images/02-1-cavemen.jpg" .center}

::: notes

Munger described the Hun-gats tribe as a pre-historic human community  that was running out of food

- The tribe lacks information on what new foods are safe to eat and what are not

- Survival odds are maximized by coordinating our experimentation on food!

- Every man for himself leads to rampant death through wasted experimentation

<br>

Bottom line:

1. Policy is not optional in a community if you want to survive

2. There was never a "state of nature"

    - Stop pretending your intuitions about what people would do without government matter for how we should govern ourselves

3. Battles over expertise are unavoidable and a key part of the process!

    - There is no "perfect" policy, all policies create winners and losers

<br>

**SLIDE**: If there is no perfect policy, what do we aim for?

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

### To maximize your chances of success, your policy proposals must be:

::: {.r-fit-text}
- Specific,

- Adapted to the stakeholders,

- Adapted to the science of the problem, 

- Adapted to the rules of the community, and

- Be at least as good as the alternatives.
:::

::: notes

*Read slide*

<br>

I'm not saying you can't create rules that violate these characteristics, but you shouldn't if the goal is to produce durable and positive change in a community!

<br>

**SLIDE**: And that took us to the SUPER important pre-requisites for all public policy

:::




## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Policymaking Pre-Requisites**

<br>

You must convince the community that:

1. We have a public problem, and

2. We require a collective decision to solve it
:::

::: notes

Each pre-requisite is a distinct argument that you have to successfully make before moving to any actual policy-design

<br>

**What does it mean to say we have a public problem? As opposed to what?**

- (**Private Problem**: "My choice has no consequence for your welfare")

- (**Public Problem**: "My choices affect your welfare"

<br>

**What does it mean to say we require a collective decision? As opposed to what?**

- (**Individual Decision**: "I can choose, alone and without interference")

- (**Collective Decision**: "Choices are made by a group, and are binding on all")

<br>

**Any questions on the material from last week?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: This week I want us to perform a comparative case study of local communities dealing with environmental problems

:::

**Environmental Problems in Local Communities**

- Tuesday: Snow Day (whoops)

- Thursday: Failure & Success Cases

:::

![](Images/02_1-case_studies.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

*NOTE: Moved the "explaining theory" slides to right before that part of the exercise*

<br>

This case study exercise has two broad aims:

<br>

FIRST, I want us to help each other develop a broader list of specific examples of local communities grappling with environmental problems

- As we move into community work, the broader your base of examples the more adaptable you will be to the needs of specific communities

- You don't have to reinvent the wheel for each problem you confront

- Use the examples to help you avoid common roadblocks and select more effective strategies

<br>

SECOND, we use a comparative case study exercise to give you a head start on thinking about policy-making in terms of theory and process

- While our work in this class will tend to focus on hands-on activities...

- Learning to think about these problems as a social scientist, in terms of observation, measurement and theory, will make you a more effective community activist

<br>

*Split class in half and assign one half to successes and other to failures*

- Groups, sit together and claim space on 1/2 the big board

<br>

Normally we'd take a few minutes to introduce the cases, but we have work to do and that would take ages!

- **SLIDE**: Ok, groups let's start by identifying the common characteristics

:::




## Analyzing the Cases {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

**1. Characteristics of the Environmental Problems**

- What are the common characteristics for the environmental problems in our cases?

- Make a list of **AT LEAST FIVE** characteristics

::: notes

Group 1, you focus on the failure cases only and group 2 focus on the successes only

- **Is everybody clear on what I'm asking you to do?**

- Go!

- *You go around and keep pushing them to make five clear ideas*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Characteristics of the Community

:::



## Analyzing the Cases {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

**2. Characteristics of the Community**

- What are the common characteristics for the communities in our cases?

- Make a list of **AT LEAST FIVE** characteristics

::: notes

Ok, groups let's do it again but now focus on the community in each case

- What do these communities have in common?

- Group 1 still focus on the failures and Group 2 on the successes

- **Questions on the task?**

- Go!

- *You go around and keep pushing them to make five clear ideas*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Characteristics of the Policy

:::



## Analyzing the Cases {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

**3. Characteristics of the Policy**

- What are the common characteristics for the policies in our cases?

- Make a list of **AT LEAST FIVE** characteristics

::: notes

Ok, groups, last time but now focus on what the policies in your cases have in common

- Group 1 still focus on the failures and Group 2 on the successes

- **Questions on the task?**

- Go!

- *You go around and keep pushing them to make five clear ideas*

<br>

Ok, groups, you have reflected on all of the cases today and used them to generate lists of characteristics common to these failures

- Our job now shifts from classifying cases to theorizing explanations

<br>

**SLIDE**: What do I mean by "theorizing explanations"?

:::



## Theory as a Scientific Tool {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

### Why do some communities successfully solve serious environmental problems while others do not?

::: notes

Let's say this is the research question we are exploring this week with our case studies.

<br>

**Give me one of the characteristics you just brainstormed for environmental policy failure**

- (**SLIDE**)

:::






## Theory as a Scientific Tool {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width = 10, fig.height=2}
## Manual DAG
d1 <- tibble(
  x = c(-3, 3),
  y = c(1, 1),
  labels = c("Predictor", "Policy\nOutcomes")
)

ggplot(data = d1, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size = 0, color = "white") +
  theme_void() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-4, 4)) +
  geom_label(aes(label = labels), size = 7) +
  annotate("segment", x = -1.9, xend = 1.85, y = 1, yend = 1, arrow = arrow())
```

::: notes

Ok, put that characteristic in this diagram in place of the word "predictor"

- e.g. that is the variable we are suggesting causes variation in policy outcomes

- The arrow represents the direction of causality

- Here variations in the predictor cause variations in the outcome

- You may refer to this in other classes as an independent and dependent variable

<br>

**Now, tell me the story of WHY you believe THIS specific predictor causes variation in policy outcomes**

- **Why does this arrow exist AND why does it point in this direction?**

- (*DISCUSS*)

<br>

Your explanation why (e.g. the story behind this arrow) IS your theory

- Theories, in science, are the stories we have designed to help us explain the world

- They are simplifications of complex processes meant to help us understand why things happen the way that they do

<br>

Somebody give us an example from their major!

- **What is a theory you have studied and what does it help us explain?**

- *REPEAT*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Why do scientists spend time generating and testing theories?

## Theory as a Scientific Tool {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

![](Images/02_1-topo-map-1.webp){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

I particularly like the analogy of theories as maps

- This topographic map is super useful for planning a hike

- Close together lines mean steep elevation changes, far apart means more gradual

- We can use this to plan a gentle stroll or a strenuous challenge!

<br>

Thanks to this map we don't have to start from scratch in navigating the world

- The map provides guidance to navigating a complex set of processes

- As community problem-solvers the more we understand the maps, the more effective we can be in our community

<br>

**Any big picture questions on theory as scientific explanations?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Back to our cases

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Theories of Environmental Problem-Solving**
:::

<br>

### We are MORE / LESS likely to solve an environmental problem when...

- The problem looks like X

- The community looks like Y

- The action taken looks like Z

::: notes

*Split each big group into three smaller groups and assign each sub-group to one category*

<br>

Ok, groups, take your lists of characteristics and use them to generate theories of environmental problem-solving

- Basically, I want you to describe for me the characteristics you believe make addressing an environmental problem harder AND give us the reason WHY

- Aim for one theory per category!

- **Make sense?**

- Go!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Next class
