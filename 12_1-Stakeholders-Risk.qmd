**Engaging Productively as Problem-Solvers**

1) **Describe** the problem facing our community

2) **Investigate** the relevant stakeholders

3) **Frame** the problem for the stakeholders

4) **Design** a policy to address the problem

5) Take **action** to push the plan forward!

::::

::: notes

Currently you are working in groups to complete Step 2

- Remember, your new stakeholder submissions are due before class April 1st

<br>

*This time only because you changed the assignment after class*

Given the specific and smaller nature of some of the stakeholders we are focused on for this problem I emailed everyone a slight modification to the assignment prompt for Apr 1st

- Reach out to your selected stakeholder for information relevant to your problem definition. 

- Be respectful of their time, but don't be afraid to introduce yourself and your work on this problem to see if they have thoughts about food waste they would be willing to share. 
- **BEFORE you do this you must share with me your proposed questions so I can keep an eye on the process and help steer you in positive directions.**

<br>

**Any questions on the exercise? Concerns about reaching out?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Reminder on Week 12 assignments

### **Aim: Develop a useful problem-framing for food waste in our community**

- Problem Framing Report due Apr 11th (end Wk 12)

- Week 12: No in-person class Week 12 (Apr 8 and 10)

- Register for volunteer hours here: [https://ozarksfoodharvest.org/how-to-help/volunteer/]()

- **Submit a reflection on the exercise to Canvas**

## Analyzing Stakeholders {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

- Risk aversion (or risk acceptance)

- Temporal discounting and uncertainty

- Collective action problems and free-riding

:::

::: notes

As I'm sure you are seeing from your own work, stakeholders vary in many idiosyncratic ways

- e.g. unique to an individual

- A plumber's view of water quality will certainly be different from a gardener's view

<br>

This list represents ways our stakeholders will vary from each other but in broadly generalizable ways

- Analyzing stakeholders will be easier as you develop your understandings of these concepts

- These will also become useful checklists for thinking about policy design and effectiveness

<br>

Today we explore risk aversion and risk acceptance.

- Disputes over perceived risk tend to seriously complicate how stakeholders define problems and how they evaluate proposed solutions.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Of course, to talk about risk we have to first talk about probability.

::: notes

*Distribute pennies*

<br>

**Let’s start with this, what is the probability of getting heads when you flip a penny?**

- **How do you know?**

<br>

**Assuming a probability of 50%, how many heads would you expect if i asked you to flip your coin ten times?**

- (5 heads, right?)

<br>

Ok, let's test your intuition!

- Flip your penny ten times and record the number of heads.

<br>

*Gather results and update next slide*

#  tails = 0
# )
```

::: notes

**What do we learn from our experiment?**

- **Was our estimate of the probability of getting heads wrong or did we do our experiment wrong?**

<br>

Over just a few flips of the coin, many results are possible.

- However, as a class you just flipped the coin `r classsize*10` times.

- That is plenty times to start to zoom in on the actual probability of these pennies. 

<br>

**SLIDE**: If we average all of your flips together we get:
:::


## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.asp=0.618, fig.width=5}
## Make bar plot with mean

  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(d$heads), color = "red", size = 1.2) +
  annotate("text", x = 8, y = 5, label = str_c("Mean: ", round(mean(d$heads), 1)), color = "red", size = 6)

```

::: notes

**Given this result, what is the probability of heads using our pennies?**

<br>

Ok, let's make sure we're clear.

**Based on this exercise, I want you to define the word probabiility for me.**

<br>

(The probability is the likelihood of an event over the long run.)

- If we flip these pennies many, many, many times we should get heads about this proportion of the time.

- In other words, the probability is what we expect to happen if we could repeat a choice or an action many, many times.

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Images/05-1-weather_forecast.png')
```

::: notes

Think about this as it relates to the weather.

<br>

**When the weather person tells you there is a 25% chance of rain today, what are they telling you?**

<br>

If you lived this day one hundred times, it would rain approximately 25 times.

- in other words, they ran a computer simulation of today's weather a bunch of times and on one quarter of their simulations it rained, and on 3/4's of them it didn't

<br>

**So, when the weather forecast is for a 50% chance of rain today, what does that actually mean?**

- (**SLIDE**)
:::



## {background-image="Images/05-1-confused_weatherman.jpg" .center}

::: notes

(It rained in half of the simulations)

- In other words, they have no idea what is going to happen today.

<br>

**What does this mean for us, a group of people who will only live today one time?**

- **Do I bring an umbrella to work on a 50% chance of rain day or not?**

+ ?

<br>

THIS is where your personal level of risk aversion or acceptance comes in!

- The probability tells you the tendency of an event, but not the certainty of it.

- YOU then have to decide the risks and rewards of acting as if that event will or won't happen.

<br>

### Don’t worry about the math, just tell me, does the intuition of a  probability make sense?

+ It is the likelihood of an event **over the long run**.

```

::: notes

Here I've converted all of your maximums into a % of the possible winnings.

- So, if you would pay $2.50 for the $5 game then you would pay half the possible winnings to play (e.g. 50%)

- Anybody on the 45 degree line represents someone equally willing to take on the risk regardless of the stakes

<br>

**Ok, describe to me the risk profiles in our class**

- **What do we learn from this?**

<br>

- **Is the group mostly risk averse or acceptant? Why?**

- **Who, as individuals, stands out on the extremes?**

<br>

**Why aren't all the observations on the diagonal line?**

- **Shouldn't your offer to play the $100 game be exactly 20 times your answer in the $5 game?**

<br>

Everyone has a different relationship to risk

- Some people are more willing to take on risk to win greater rewards and some people are not

- Not right or wrong, just different willingness to accept risk.

<br>

Your relationship to risk is sensitive to both the size of the risk AND the size of the reward!

- If you are above the diagonal line then you are someone who is more willing to take on risk when the stakes are high, e.g. you are risk acceptant

- If you are below the line then you are more price sensitive, e.g. you are more risk averse

<br>

**Does that make sense?**

**What do we learn about risk profiles from these three scenarios and your responses to them?**

<br>

Stakeholders risk profiles will vary with their perceptions

- e.g. Context matters

<br>

AND, even more importantly, it means that you can move them with argument and good policy design!

- **Does everybody see how risk profiles matter for understanding stakeholder decisionmaking?**

<br>

- **And does everybody see that it should be possible to influence stakeholder risk profiles?**

## Ehrlich & Ehrlich (2008) {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

- We are rapidly depleting the natural capital of the Earth

- Damage = Population x Consumption x Technology

- Population control is controversial

- Overconsumption is complex and difficult to reduce

- Technology improvements cannot save us

Therefore, a combination of overpopulation and overconsumption has us on track for disaster

**Is this an argument that we should be risk averse or acceptant when thinking about populations and consumption?**

- (VERY risk averse, right?)

**OLD Notes**

+ (We are rapidly depleting the natural capital of the Earth; soil, groundwater, biodiversity)
+ (Negative Impact = Pop x Consumption x Technology)
+ (Technology improvements can help but cannot save us)
+ (Many past human societies have collapsed under the weight of overpopulation and environmental neglect, e.g. see Easter Island, the Mayans, and Nineveh)
+ (It is getting harder to locate the resources we need, e.g. have to mine deeper, use poorer soils, etc)
+ (Population control is controversial on both the left and the right though for different reasons and the media is "pro-natalist" in its framings of these stories, e.g. more births are good)
+ (Tackling overconsumption is complex and very, very difficult)

**Old NOTES**

+ (Overpopulation hysteria has cost us dearly, distracted us from improving lives through targeting economic and political systems)
+ (The research shows "that faster population growth is not associated with slower economic growth")
+ (Market-directed economies do better than centrally planned ones)
+ (As with man-made production capital, so it is with natural resources: Shortages lead to the discovery of substitutes)
+ (Shortages ACTUALLY tend to leave us better off than before)
+ (The only serious shortage is ACTUALLY human beings!)
+ (The most important benefit of population size and growth is the increase it brings to the stock of useful knowledge.)
+ (Progress is limited largely by the availability of trained workers.)

Therefore, it is reasonable to expect "that the energetic effort of humankind will prevail in the future, as they have in the past, to increase worldwide our numbers, our health, our wealth, and our opportunities" (10))

**Is everybody clear on how differing levels of risk aversion complicate environmental problem-solving?**

<br>

Today's work is meant to help you think critically about:

1. HOW stakeholders vary in their relationship to risk, and

2. HOW problem framing is often an exercise in trying to move stakeholders' risk profiles in relation to a specific problem

<br>

**Did you find one of these problem framing exercises today more convincing than the other (e.g. Ehrlich and Ehrlich vs Simon)? Why or why not?**

<br>

A big part of your job working in a community will be to develop a compelling problem framing that draws in both sets of actors across this divide.

- **Is there any room between the Ehrlich's and Simon on these problems?**

- **In other words, could we present a problem-framing that gets both these actors on our side?**
